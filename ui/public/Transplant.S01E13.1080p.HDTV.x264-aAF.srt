- Am I close?
- Keep going.

7
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,914
I think I nicked something.
Her spleen is ruptured.

8
00:00:18,694 --> 00:00:20,328
The punctured spleen.

9
00:00:20,353 --> 00:00:22,315
With a mistake like that,
what happens next?

10
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,906
There'll be an internal review.

11
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:26,179
I was the one
who inserted the tube,

12
00:00:26,204 --> 00:00:27,772
so if anyone deserves
the blame for it...

13
00:00:27,797 --> 00:00:29,445
I was on imaging,
guiding placement.

14
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:30,737
You know that.

15
00:00:30,953 --> 00:00:32,187
Sir.

16
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,492
About what happened with the imaging...

17
00:00:35,517 --> 00:00:38,250
Get back to me with
a differential on Sonja Jessup.

18
00:00:38,275 --> 00:00:39,876
ASAP.

19
00:00:48,062 --> 00:00:50,162
When I was putting in
the chest tube,

20
00:00:50,187 --> 00:00:51,406
what did you notice

21
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:53,359
when Dr. Bishop was guiding placement?

22
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:54,854
Same thing you did.

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:56,445
His first measurement was off.

24
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,571
He misread the imaging on the monitor...

25
00:00:59,964 --> 00:01:01,858
Was it that he misread
the monitor?

26
00:01:01,883 --> 00:01:03,718
Or more like he couldn't see it?

27
00:01:04,734 --> 00:01:07,937
It was like it wasn't even
in his field of vision.

28
00:01:08,762 --> 00:01:11,718
I know you and Dr. Bishop
are close.

29
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:14,366
This is in confidence?

30
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:15,783
Of course.

31
00:01:15,808 --> 00:01:17,381
About a month ago, I noticed him

32
00:01:17,406 --> 00:01:19,578
treating himself for
post-concussive nausea.

33
00:01:19,603 --> 00:01:22,545
That's not abnormal
after his head injury,

34
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:24,195
- and the surgery he had.
- I know.

35
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,444
I'm not trying to avoid
responsibility for what happened.

36
00:01:27,469 --> 00:01:29,921
I made the incision, and
I'll take the blame for it.

37
00:01:29,946 --> 00:01:31,164
But...

38
00:01:32,307 --> 00:01:34,822
But if his nausea's progressed
to vision problems,

39
00:01:34,847 --> 00:01:36,335
what if he's getting worse?

40
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,414
Yesterday, a nurse came up
with a chart.

41
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,906
He didn't see that either.

42
00:01:39,931 --> 00:01:43,218
He brushed it off, I didn't
think anything about it.

43
00:01:44,008 --> 00:01:45,842
The question is, is he intentionally

44
00:01:45,867 --> 00:01:47,281
downplaying the symptoms?

45
00:01:47,306 --> 00:01:49,171
What if they caught him
by surprise?

46
00:01:49,196 --> 00:01:50,997

182
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:31,343
I meant it.

183
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:34,232
Call your doctor.

184
00:07:34,592 --> 00:07:36,359
Seem him today.

185
00:07:42,792 --> 00:07:45,586
<i>(BASHIR): We're still hopeful the
rupture will heal on its own</i>

186
00:07:45,611 --> 00:07:47,672
Other than what happened
to her spleen,

187
00:07:47,697 --> 00:07:49,643
have you figured out what's
causing her symptoms?

188
00:07:49,668 --> 00:07:52,503
So far, the tests we've run
haven't given us any answers.

189
00:07:52,528 --> 00:07:54,662
We need your help narrowing
down the possibilities.

190
00:07:54,687 --> 00:07:57,054
Can you think of anything,

191
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,953
any symptoms or underlying
medical conditions

192
00:07:59,978 --> 00:08:01,281
that she's been diagnosed with?

193
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:02,851
Or any injuries she's sustained

194
00:08:02,876 --> 00:08:04,336
even going back years?

195
00:08:05,172 --> 00:08:07,742
Sonja and I met when we were 18.

196
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,539
I knew everything there
was to know about her

197
00:08:09,564 --> 00:08:10,585
for the longest time.

198
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,877
She was always basically healthy.

199
00:08:11,902 --> 00:08:14,070
Until her back pain, her addiction.

200
00:08:14,266 --> 00:08:15,666
I love her.

201
00:08:15,691 --> 00:08:18,039
And I want my wife back.

202
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:25,207
Joel, why don't you take your sister

203
00:08:25,232 --> 00:08:27,047
to the vending machines
to get something? Okay?

204
00:08:27,072 --> 00:08:28,079
Okay. Thanks, Dad.

205
00:08:28,104 --> 00:08:29,922
- One each, guys.
- Okay, Mom.

206
00:08:29,947 --> 00:08:32,752
(CHUCKLING) They're adorable.

207
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:34,007
Thank you.

208
00:08:34,032 --> 00:08:35,528
How are you feeling
since waking up?

209
00:08:35,553 --> 00:08:37,906
Tired. My body hurts everywhere.

210
00:08:37,931 --> 00:08:40,297
The doctors need to ask you
some questions.

211
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:41,872
Sonja, we need to figure out

212
00:08:41,897 --> 00:08:43,879
whether you may have been
exposed to something.

213
00:08:43,904 --> 00:08:45,632
You're thinking this
is something I caught?

214
00:08:45,657 --> 00:08:48,322
There is an infection called
endocarditis which could explain

215
00:08:48,347 --> 00:08:50,014
your symptoms. (COUGHING)

216
00:08:50,293 --> 00:08:52,918
If there's been any, um...

217
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:56,290
well, any intravenous
drug use, even months ago.

218
00:08:56,315 --> 00:08:57,882
You think I was shooting up?

219
00:08:57,907 --> 00:09:00,270
- No, we're...
- I would never do that.

220
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:02,309
I know I messed up yesterday,

221
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:03,968
but I was only taking pills.

222
00:09:03,993 --> 00:09:05,529
How long have you had these?

223
00:09:05,554 --> 00:09:08,832
- Spider veins on your leg?
- Years. Ten years, at least.

224
00:09:08,857 --> 00:09:11,292
My GP said they're nothing
to worry about. You...

225
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,878
You believe me, right?

226
00:09:12,903 --> 00:09:15,805
- (COUGHING)
- What is happening to her?!

227

(BEEPING)

228
00:09:17,389 --> 00:09:18,834
Put your head back.

229
00:09:18,859 --> 00:09:21,247
Put your head back. Just stay there.

230
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,248
Any closer to finding
anyone who knows this man?

231
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:27,082
Viv was able to reach his GP.

232
00:09:27,107 --> 00:09:29,778
But no spouse and no kids.

233
00:09:33,442 --> 00:09:34,943
Jesus.

234
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:37,828
Ah, this tumour
has more legs than a spider.

235
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:40,622
It's wrapped around his liver.

236
00:09:41,574 --> 00:09:43,876
It's encroaching on his pancreas

237
00:09:43,901 --> 00:09:45,194
and it's stuck to his bowel.

238
00:09:45,219 --> 00:09:46,997
Have you ever seen
anything like this before?

239
00:09:47,022 --> 00:09:48,973
Ah, it's in the lining
of his abdomen,

240
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,927
could be colorectal cancer

241
00:09:50,952 --> 00:09:54,762
- or malignant mesothelioma.
- So what do we do?

242
00:09:55,085 --> 00:09:58,233
Unfortunately, there's
not much we can do, Dr. Curtis,

243
00:09:58,567 --> 00:10:01,291
other than divert and refer oncology.

244
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:04,856
He's lucky if he has a week.

245
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,692
Let's close up.

246
00:10:09,805 --> 00:10:11,545
Sonja's intubated.

247
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:13,104
Anything back from her CT?

248
00:10:13,129 --> 00:10:14,574
Still waiting.

249
00:10:19,567 --> 00:10:21,079
They met so young.

250
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:23,921
You could end up being married
to someone who isn't anything

251
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:26,209
like the person they started out as.

252
00:10:26,497 --> 00:10:28,879
Or it just means
that you change together.

253
00:10:30,222 --> 00:10:31,967
My parents met at 18

254
00:10:31,992 --> 00:10:35,177
and they were more in love than
any couple I've ever seen.

255
00:10:37,251 --> 00:10:39,056
Results are up.

256
00:10:41,819 --> 00:10:44,062
Her spleen won't stop bleeding.

257
00:10:44,589 --> 00:10:46,265
The blood's filling up her abdomen.

258
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:47,522
We've caused too much damage.

259
00:10:47,547 --> 00:10:49,859
They're going to have to remove it.

to dress up like his dog?

264
00:11:21,168 --> 00:11:22,840
The X-rays came back.

265
00:11:23,176 --> 00:11:25,232
Unfortunately, the last few days

266
00:11:25,257 --> 00:11:27,950
took their toll on Finn's lungs.

267
00:11:28,159 --> 00:11:30,994
I know that's not something
you want to hear right now.

268
00:11:31,082 --> 00:11:33,945
I'm not responding
to the antibiotics?

269

Your infection's
getting worse. Pneumonia.

Your CF team is on their way down.

272
00:11:39,951 --> 00:11:42,954
But, um... we're not gonna
be able to stop it.

273
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:46,082
The vest didn't help?

274
00:11:46,107 --> 00:11:47,416
What about PEP?

275
00:11:47,441 --> 00:11:49,121
Or a bi-pap?

276
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,831
- (COUGHING)
- Those would buy time.

277
00:11:53,606 --> 00:11:55,598
But it wouldn't stop the decompensation.

00:11:59,665 --> 00:12:01,097
Okay.

00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,474
Okay. We're prepared for this. Right?

281
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:05,182
We've been on the
transplant list for months.

282
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:07,577
And this moves Finn
up to the top, right?

283
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,158
The list is based on need, yeah.

284
00:12:11,183 --> 00:12:14,085
It doesn't matter
because it's too late.

Finn! Don't say that!

286

Hey, that is not
what's happening here, okay.

287
00:12:17,377 --> 00:12:18,936

293
00:12:35,150 --> 00:12:37,425
your infection is too advanced.

What happened?

303
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:22,227
They were prepping for her splenectomy

304
00:13:22,252 --> 00:13:24,139
when she started to seize.

305
00:13:24,164 --> 00:13:26,298
She seized? Why?

306
00:13:26,926 --> 00:13:28,387
We don't know.

307
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:30,720
Well, we've stabilized her,

308
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:33,159
but, uh... they can't remove the organ

309
00:13:33,184 --> 00:13:35,544

we're dealing with.

we're making progress,

313
00:13:43,444 --> 00:13:45,858
she seems to be getting worse.

(SIGHING) Take me through your thinking.

315
00:13:51,643 --> 00:13:54,511
All of her symptoms.
The fluid around her heart.

316
00:13:54,536 --> 00:13:56,192
The fluid on her lungs.

317
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,542
We can't see how they're connected.

318
00:13:58,567 --> 00:14:00,702
She's negative for respiratory virus,

319
00:14:00,727 --> 00:14:02,278
and her white blood cells are normal,

320
00:14:02,303 --> 00:14:04,505
which means there's not
an infection either.

321
00:14:05,098 --> 00:14:06,848
The fact is she's been here two days

322
00:14:06,873 --> 00:14:08,630
and we still don't know
what's wrong with her.

323
00:14:08,655 --> 00:14:10,716
Other than the ruptured
spleen, which we caused.

324
00:14:10,741 --> 00:14:13,810
And before we could
repair that, the seizure.

325
00:14:15,304 --> 00:14:17,906
Basically, all we know
is that she's extremely ill,

326
00:14:17,931 --> 00:14:19,532
and her prognosis is worsening

327
00:14:19,557 --> 00:14:21,368

in Trauma last night.

this to hold you back.

Okay, um... Well, let's go back
to the beginning.

412
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:21,203
So, Sonja was in a car accident.

413
00:19:21,228 --> 00:19:23,610
But you wanted to rule
out a brain injury.

414
00:19:23,635 --> 00:19:25,774
No visible head trauma.
Her resp rate was low

415
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:27,602
which I mistook for
symptoms of opioid use,

416
00:19:27,627 --> 00:19:29,562
and then, heart and lung fluid

417
00:19:29,587 --> 00:19:31,158
almost killed her later that day.

418
00:19:31,183 --> 00:19:33,235
Her drug use raised the
possibility of endocarditis,

419
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:35,202
but she said she wasn't
using intravenously.

420
00:19:35,227 --> 00:19:36,858
Which was confirmed
by bacterial culture.

421
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:39,085
Also, the CT scan of Sonja's
head came back clear,

422
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:40,680
so we know it's not a brain injury...

423
00:19:40,705 --> 00:19:42,946

to an underlying cause.

a penetrating head trauma

sat there for months.

He did a three-hour

"The pancreas is an ass, which is why
it deserves more of our attention."

- Right. Yeah.
- Why?

maybe someone like Doctor Waldon could.

Yeah. Yeah, thank you.

00:24:03,979 --> 00:24:06,780
- You saw the radiologist?
- You were right.

502
00:24:07,572 --> 00:24:10,335
- An "AVM?"
- "Arteriovenous malformation."

503
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,190
It's a rare, abnormal connection

504
00:24:12,215 --> 00:24:14,376
between a person's arteries and veins.

505
00:24:14,401 --> 00:24:16,635
Then this had nothing to do
with her drug use?

506
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,601
She was probably born with them.

507
00:24:18,773 --> 00:24:20,721
AVMs disrupt circulation

508
00:24:20,746 --> 00:24:22,765
and can cause a range of
life-threatening symptoms.

509
00:24:22,790 --> 00:24:24,179
They can happen anywhere.

510
00:24:24,204 --> 00:24:26,413
In Sonja's case, we identified one

511
00:24:26,438 --> 00:24:28,382
in her lungs and one on her spine,

512
00:24:28,407 --> 00:24:30,554
but it's the kind of thing you
don't even know to look for

513
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:32,313
until the other symptoms develop.

514
00:24:32,338 --> 00:24:35,540
She's gonna need a surgical
procedure called an embolization.

515
00:24:35,565 --> 00:24:38,804
But you said she's got
one of these things on her spine?

516
00:24:39,864 --> 00:24:42,381
Could it have caused her
back pain in the first place?

517
00:24:42,406 --> 00:24:43,913
It's possible. Even likely.

spleen in her abdomen.

00:25:27,054 --> 00:25:28,372
- Call OR.
- Yeah.

536

We finally know what's wrong with her.

539
00:25:33,541 --> 00:25:35,423
And if she bleeds out because
we punctured her spleen,

540
00:25:35,448 --> 00:25:37,483
- then Dr. Bishop...
- Is on the line.

541
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:41,193
- The OR says ten.
- She may not have ten.

542

In trauma.

543

But you should know she brought
a full team here with her.

- Yeah. I know.

00:39:57,137 --> 00:39:58,938
I mean, I'll consider it.

714
00:39:59,113 --> 00:40:01,274
You do that.

715
00:40:05,914 --> 00:40:09,367
- You okay?
- Yeah, actually.

716
00:40:10,173 --> 00:40:11,406
You?

717
00:40:12,013 --> 00:40:15,498
Uh, I... I don't know.

718
00:40:18,052 --> 00:40:19,888
You know, it was Bishop who told me

719
00:40:19,913 --> 00:40:21,629
that if I wasn't careful,

720
00:40:21,654 --> 00:40:23,964
this place would swallow me whole.

721
00:40:24,592 --> 00:40:27,258
But if even he can't stop
that from happening...

722
00:40:27,283 --> 00:40:29,720
Then what chance
do any of us have?

723
00:40:30,697 --> 00:40:32,180
Look.

724
00:40:33,556 --> 00:40:35,504
You don't strike me as someone

725
00:40:35,529 --> 00:40:37,530
who would back down from a challenge.

726
00:40:37,746 --> 00:40:39,604
Just saying.

727
00:40:47,478 --> 00:40:50,448
Hey. I'm glad you came.

728
00:40:50,662 --> 00:40:52,117
I'm glad you called.

729
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:53,869
This way.

730
00:41:02,441 --> 00:41:04,880
I'll be just outside if you need me.

731
00:41:13,144 --> 00:41:14,848
Hi, Dad.

732
00:41:21,311 --> 00:41:23,899
Has he said anything yet?

733
00:41:24,046 --> 00:41:25,480
Not yet.

734
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,073
He's lucky to have you
in his life.

735
00:41:35,425 --> 00:41:37,038
You too.

(IN ARABIC):

738
00:42:58,498 --> 00:43:00,871
I thought you were dead.
