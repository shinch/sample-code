about the tensor bandage.

off circulation.

severe abdominal pain.

The nurses say he's
vomited several times.

401

I looked at the MRI.
He hasn't had a stroke.

if it's something you'd
like to consider.

700
00:35:51,883 --> 00:35:53,415
Please, Mom.

701
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:55,140

I cannot go through this again, Danny.

705
00:36:05,297 --> 00:36:06,987
I'm sorry.

706
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,155
I promise.

707
00:36:13,641 --> 00:36:14,948
Okay.

708
00:36:15,149 --> 00:36:17,050
We'll hear what they
have to say together,

709
00:36:17,075 --> 00:36:19,003
and we'll take it from there.

710
00:36:20,256 --> 00:36:21,723
I won't change my mind.

711
00:36:21,748 --> 00:36:23,712
I'm not promising to change mine.

712
00:36:24,565 --> 00:36:26,125
Just...

713
00:36:26,375 --> 00:36:30,009
one step at a time, okay baby?

714
00:36:31,328 --> 00:36:33,777
Will you be disappointed in me

715
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:36,141
if this isn't a phase?

716
00:36:37,986 --> 00:36:39,977
Danny, you're my kid.

717
00:36:41,744 --> 00:36:43,273
You're my son.

718
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:49,279
I love you no matter what.

719

You know who you are.

720
00:36:55,468 --> 00:36:57,162
That's pretty amazing.

721
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:05,701
Uh...

I'm gonna... Can you...?

724
00:37:10,194 --> 00:37:13,260
I can't. I need you to look at them.

725
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:23,453
Jesus, it's not Moby Dick.

726
00:37:23,478 --> 00:37:25,356
It's all clear.

(SOFT MUSIC)

728
00:37:58,954 --> 00:38:01,304
You're gonna tell me there's
nothing wrong with me,

729
00:38:01,329 --> 00:38:02,864
that's why they had me get dressed.

730
00:38:02,889 --> 00:38:04,423
Actually, I'm not.

731
00:38:06,101 --> 00:38:07,669
You're worried about being sick,

732
00:38:07,694 --> 00:38:09,352
so your body is manifesting symptoms.

733
00:38:09,377 --> 00:38:11,985
No, I have a heart problem,

734
00:38:12,010 --> 00:38:13,946
it's... it's real, I know it.

735
00:38:13,971 --> 00:38:15,134
I know it feels real.

736
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:16,813
You're just like the rest of them!

737
00:38:16,838 --> 00:38:17,967
It's all in my head!

738
00:38:17,992 --> 00:38:19,977
This? Coming into
the emergency department,

739
00:38:20,002 --> 00:38:22,055
isn't going to stop this from happening.

I'm scared I'm gonna die all the time.

There are people
who you can speak to.

743
00:38:28,435 --> 00:38:30,656
I can refer you to our staff
psychiatrist, Dr. Mitchell.

744
00:38:30,681 --> 00:38:33,799
I've talked to shrinks before.
They do nothing!

745
00:38:33,824 --> 00:38:36,194
Because, Kevin, you
have to want that help.

746
00:38:36,219 --> 00:38:38,119
You have to accept that you need it.

747
00:38:38,144 --> 00:38:40,588
- No, you are not listening!
- I'm listening.

748

Ah, I'm such a lightweight.

Are you still good for later?

Listen, maybe
I didn't mention this,

755
00:39:05,044 --> 00:39:07,251
but I'm married.

756

You told me.
She's a real estate agent.

757
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:12,530
You showed me pictures of your kids.

758

What does that have to do with
you coming on a ride along?

759
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:19,178
I can't today.

760
00:39:19,555 --> 00:39:21,422
But thanks anyway.

761
00:39:21,447 --> 00:39:24,014
Well, if you find yourself stuck
here bored some other weekend,

762
00:39:24,039 --> 00:39:26,040
I usually work on Saturdays.

763

Is he doing alright?

00:39:34,422 --> 00:39:36,423
Your patient who wanted to transition.

766
00:39:36,448 --> 00:39:39,156
Better. He still wants surgery,

767
00:39:39,181 --> 00:39:41,227
but he's relieved there's a way forward.

768
00:39:41,252 --> 00:39:43,775
Thank you for organizing that
referral to the gender clinic.

with you being away this much?

in Emerg pediatrics opening up.

If you want to apply, you'd
have my recommendation.

774
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:00,564
thank you.

775
00:40:00,589 --> 00:40:02,768
I'd have to discuss that with my wife.

776
00:40:02,793 --> 00:40:04,728
Ah, maybe they could move here?

The kind of experience you get
at a city hospital like this,

778

you're not gonna find that back home.

I'm just, I don't know.

a trauma bay thoracotomy?

Yeah.

are why we do this.

never wanted me to?

Well, if there's any
another way to do this job,

I haven't found it.

797
00:41:23,891 --> 00:41:26,224
I spent the last two days
trying to help a patient

798
00:41:26,249 --> 00:41:28,545
who didn't want the
kind of help he needed.

799
00:41:29,294 --> 00:41:31,361
