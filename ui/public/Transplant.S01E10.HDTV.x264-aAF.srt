00:10:10,266 --> 00:10:13,116
- (METAL CLANKING)
- I'm not leaving her.

184
00:10:18,662 --> 00:10:21,319
My wife... My...

185
00:10:22,802 --> 00:10:24,369
Has anyone seen...

186
00:10:24,394 --> 00:10:26,128
I've been waiting forever, okay?

187
00:10:26,153 --> 00:10:28,352
I keep trying to ask
people where she is.

188
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,178
Her name is Julia Baranski.

189
00:10:30,203 --> 00:10:31,674
Please tell me that you know.

190
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:33,270
We're moving as quickly as we can,

191
00:10:33,295 --> 00:10:34,854
but right now, things
are still backing up.

192
00:10:34,879 --> 00:10:36,385
So come with me please.

193
00:10:36,509 --> 00:10:37,642
Okay.

194
00:10:37,667 --> 00:10:39,698
- What's your name?
- Naomi.

195
00:10:39,723 --> 00:10:43,190
But Julia, I need to find her.

196
00:10:43,514 --> 00:10:45,381
I promise that we're
gonna look for Julia.

197
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,165
But right now, I need
to take care of you.

198
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,886
I tried to go back inside,
but I couldn't get in.

199
00:10:49,911 --> 00:10:51,613
You did the right thing
not to go back in.

200
00:10:51,638 --> 00:10:53,628
You have bruises and a number of wounds

201
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:55,230
that need to be treated.

202
00:10:55,522 --> 00:10:57,724
Do you have any intense pain
anywhere in particular?

203
00:10:57,749 --> 00:10:59,050
My stomach.

204
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:01,582
Okay. Lie down for me, please.

(GRUNTS)

206
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,425
Okay.

207
00:11:22,328 --> 00:11:24,201
I'm trying to find my boyfriend.

208
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,532
No one will tell me anything.

209
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:26,757
There's a list of people

210
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,220
from the explosion, at registration.

211
00:11:28,245 --> 00:11:29,962
No, no. I asked them
already and they don't...

212
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:31,796
A number of people came in without ID's.

213
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:33,121
Look, I know it's hard,

214
00:11:33,146 --> 00:11:34,413
but we've got a lot going on right now.

215
00:11:34,438 --> 00:11:36,142
We just need you to stay
patient while we sort it out.

216
00:11:36,167 --> 00:11:38,595
All right? Okay... Who is this?

217
00:11:39,977 --> 00:11:43,235
I need you to sign off on the
on-calls I'm bringing in.

218
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,353
Our biggest problem is managing

219
00:11:45,378 --> 00:11:47,688
just the minor injuries
and family coordination.

220
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:51,265
Triage nurses are doing great,
but we're barely keeping up.

221
00:11:51,290 --> 00:11:54,954
I'll tell EMS to divert the
ambulances to St. Jacobs.

222
00:11:54,979 --> 00:11:56,780
- I already did.
- Oh, good.

223
00:11:56,805 --> 00:11:59,295
Anything else you need, as you need it.

224
00:12:00,622 --> 00:12:02,356
Yeah. All right.

225
00:12:02,381 --> 00:12:03,994
Excellent, thank you.

226
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:05,452
Claire.

227
00:12:06,623 --> 00:12:10,782
(PANTING) Can anybody help me?

228
00:12:10,807 --> 00:12:13,302
- Are you looking for someone?
- I'm looking for my daughter,

229
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:14,569
she's not answering her phone.

230
00:12:14,594 --> 00:12:16,591
She goes by that building on
her way home from school.

231
00:12:16,616 --> 00:12:18,038
- How old?
- Twelve.

232
00:12:18,063 --> 00:12:20,074
Blonde hair, plaid private school skirt,

233
00:12:20,099 --> 00:12:22,284
and a green sweater.
Her name is Gabriela.

234
00:12:22,335 --> 00:12:24,495
She's in our intensive care unit.

235
00:12:25,474 --> 00:12:26,941
Intensive care?

236
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:29,163
- Is she okay?
- Come with me.

237
00:12:29,188 --> 00:12:32,003
- (GASPS)
- Nurse.

238
00:12:33,777 --> 00:12:36,352
Okay, Naomi, this is gonna be cold.

239
00:12:36,377 --> 00:12:38,358
Let me know if I'm pressing too firmly.

240
00:12:38,383 --> 00:12:41,137
(BREATHING)

241
00:12:42,276 --> 00:12:44,308
(GRUNTS)

242
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,353
Okay. I'm gonna have to...

243
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:52,273
scan to confirm, but you're
hemorrhaging inside,

244
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,286
which means our first priority right now

245
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,578
is to get you to surgery.

246
00:12:55,603 --> 00:12:57,483
How Jules is gonna find me?

247
00:12:57,508 --> 00:12:59,944
Look, if she's here, our support
staff are gonna find her

248
00:12:59,969 --> 00:13:01,301
and they're gonna tell
her where you are,

249
00:13:01,326 --> 00:13:02,566
I'll ask them to myself.

250
00:13:02,591 --> 00:13:03,820
But for now, I really need you

251
00:13:03,845 --> 00:13:05,619
to stay as still as possible. Okay?

252
00:13:11,998 --> 00:13:13,332
Miss Petrakis.

253
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,490
(GASPS) Gabby.

254
00:13:19,115 --> 00:13:20,389
What happened?

255
00:13:20,414 --> 00:13:23,216
Gabby suffered a traumatic impact,

256
00:13:23,652 --> 00:13:25,621
and she went into cardiac arrest.

257
00:13:25,809 --> 00:13:27,475
Her heart stopped?

258
00:13:27,613 --> 00:13:29,881
Yes. But we restarted it,

259
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:33,355
and we're hoping to rule out any
possible brain damage, but...

260
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,898
Brain damage?

261
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,158
Can you do anything to help her?

262
00:13:37,359 --> 00:13:40,549
We're cooling down her system in order
to decrease her brain function,

263
00:13:40,574 --> 00:13:43,198
so the lack of oxygen is less damaging.

264
00:13:43,769 --> 00:13:46,011
After enough time, we
can warm her back up,

265
00:13:46,036 --> 00:13:49,287
and her brain will reset
itself to normal functioning.

266
00:13:49,312 --> 00:13:51,873
When will we know if she's okay?

267
00:13:52,946 --> 00:13:55,044
Not until she wakes up.

268
00:13:56,266 --> 00:13:58,047
But she will...

269
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,508
wake up?

270
00:14:06,656 --> 00:14:09,141
Julia Burrenski, 33 years old,

271
00:14:09,252 --> 00:14:11,787
open tip fib fractured, lost
a lot of blood on the scene,

272
00:14:11,812 --> 00:14:13,394
possible smoke inhalation. GCS 15.

273
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:16,607
Okay. We've got this.
Welcome back, Dr. Hamed.

274
00:14:19,970 --> 00:14:21,861
Bash?

275
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:24,667
Are you okay?

276
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:26,548
Yeah. What? Am I okay? Are you?

277
00:14:26,573 --> 00:14:28,595
What were you thinking? You
could have been killed.

278
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,687
You can't just...

279
00:14:29,712 --> 00:14:31,580
Show up and volunteer as a doctor?

280
00:14:31,765 --> 00:14:34,082
- You gave blood?
- Yeah. At the scene.

281
00:14:34,107 --> 00:14:35,472
Let me check you out.

282
00:14:35,497 --> 00:14:36,824
No. This place is overflowing

283
00:14:36,849 --> 00:14:38,701
and I see one of my
patients from the building.

284
00:14:38,726 --> 00:14:40,630
I need to make sure he's okay.

285
00:14:41,669 --> 00:14:42,870
You made it.

286
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:44,690
Because of you. You found help.

287
00:14:44,715 --> 00:14:46,949
- Julia?
- She made it too.

288
00:14:47,066 --> 00:14:48,734
Gav. Has anyone looked at you?

289
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:49,995
Just some bruised ribs.

290
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,731
Nothing I haven't done mountain biking.

291
00:14:51,756 --> 00:14:54,130
Do buildings usually fall on you
when you are mountain biking.

292
00:14:54,155 --> 00:14:57,176
- (LAUGHS)
- Breathe for me, okay?

(GRUNTS)

294
00:15:05,834 --> 00:15:08,012
You said you were blown
back during the blast?

295
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,614
Yeah. I think maybe I
slammed into the wall.

296
00:15:10,723 --> 00:15:12,169
Gavin, why didn't you tell anyone?

297
00:15:12,218 --> 00:15:13,497
Julia needed you more.

298
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:14,789
Dr. Curtis?

299
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:16,912
No. Honestly, guys, you got
bigger problems than...

300
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:20,036
Gavin. You did your part
to help, let us do ours.

301
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:21,833
- What do we have?
- Impact trauma.

302
00:15:21,858 --> 00:15:23,424
Tell me what you hear.

303
00:15:29,494 --> 00:15:31,390
Bowel sounds...

304
00:15:31,573 --> 00:15:33,392
Reduced air entry.

305
00:15:35,703 --> 00:15:37,153
The porters are all backed up.

306
00:15:37,178 --> 00:15:39,067
So I'm going to take you
up to surgery myself.

307
00:15:39,092 --> 00:15:41,733
- Did you find Julia?
- Not yet.

308
00:15:43,106 --> 00:15:45,320
It doesn't mean she's not here.

309
00:15:50,887 --> 00:15:52,887
Won't be long.

310
00:15:56,087 --> 00:15:57,540
Careful.

311
00:16:12,689 --> 00:16:14,599
You think this is bad mountain biking?

312
00:16:14,624 --> 00:16:16,518
Oh, not even close.

313
00:16:18,521 --> 00:16:20,396

Dr. Hamed?

317
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,871
Do you see the disruption
at the left diaphragm?

318
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:38,411
Is that the bowel?

319
00:16:38,436 --> 00:16:41,205
Stomach, I think, I'm just... (GRUNTS)

320
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:43,128
We'll need a CT to confirm.

321
00:16:43,153 --> 00:16:44,954
Anyone want to explain?

322
00:16:45,529 --> 00:16:48,329
You may have torn your diaphragm
when you were blown backwards.

323
00:16:48,354 --> 00:16:50,616
These type of tears can
cause your abdominal organs

324
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:52,609
to protrude into your chest cavity.

325
00:16:52,634 --> 00:16:54,471
If so, you will need surgery,

326
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:57,559
but finding it early
means it's treatable.

327
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,168
Good catch, Dr. Hamed.

328
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:02,930
I'll get him to CT.

329
00:17:03,841 --> 00:17:06,509
Um, Dr. Curtis will take
care of you from here.

I heard you gave blood
at the scene today.

There were chemicals in that explosion.

could be exposed.

00:19:21,917 --> 00:19:23,580
You're sure the burns are chemical?

362
00:19:23,733 --> 00:19:26,408
It must have been something I
touched during the explosion,

363
00:19:26,433 --> 00:19:27,846
maybe even one of the patients

364
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:29,510
had that substance on their skin.

365
00:19:29,535 --> 00:19:31,225
And you didn't notice till now?

366
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,518
There are a number of corrosives
that don't take effect

367
00:19:33,543 --> 00:19:35,409
until much after contact.

368
00:19:35,434 --> 00:19:37,900
The timeline varies
depending on the chemical.

369
00:19:38,186 --> 00:19:41,268
So there's no telling who
or what you touched.

370
00:19:42,841 --> 00:19:45,184
You've seen this kind of burns before?

371
00:19:46,615 --> 00:19:49,482
Regime chemical attacks were frequent.

372
00:19:49,507 --> 00:19:50,995
Sometimes people would be exposed

373
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,776
and not know it at first.

374
00:19:55,377 --> 00:19:58,208
You need to monitor every
patient from the explosion

375
00:19:58,233 --> 00:19:59,900
to make sure they haven't been affected.

376
00:20:00,226 --> 00:20:02,730
We will. But that includes you.

377
00:20:02,755 --> 00:20:04,089
Sir, I'm fine.

378
00:20:04,114 --> 00:20:06,541
My burns are minor. They
still need to be treated.

379
00:20:06,566 --> 00:20:08,834
So do the people who
might have been exposed.

380
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:10,376
We're busy. They need my help.

381
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:12,035
And they will get it.

382
00:20:12,867 --> 00:20:15,463
As soon as you finish
irrigating your burns

383
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,314
and do a pH assessment.

384
00:20:17,648 --> 00:20:19,762
Understood? Good.

385
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:21,429
I'll send a nurse?

386
00:20:29,982 --> 00:20:32,784
Is there anyone else presenting
with chemical burns?

387
00:20:32,809 --> 00:20:35,096
We've been screening, so far nothing.

388
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:38,196
Triage knows to alert us
if they see any signs.

389
00:20:38,565 --> 00:20:40,088
How's Bash?

390
00:20:40,113 --> 00:20:42,868
His burns are minor and
we caught them in time.

391
00:20:43,862 --> 00:20:45,242
You're worried about him?

392
00:20:45,267 --> 00:20:47,122
He's seen chemicals like this before,

393
00:20:47,147 --> 00:20:48,832
during the war.

394
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,581
Dr. Bishop.

395
00:20:50,606 --> 00:20:52,628
We've got a problem with
one of the elevators.

396
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:53,986
Have you called Mechanical?

397
00:20:54,011 --> 00:20:56,214
Yes, but I think you
need to come with me.

398
00:21:02,623 --> 00:21:04,757
Hi. Can I help you?

399
00:21:04,945 --> 00:21:06,934
I still can't find my boyfriend.

400
00:21:06,959 --> 00:21:08,759
Did you check with triage?

401
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:10,720
They have the most updated
list from the explosion.

402
00:21:10,745 --> 00:21:12,279
Yeah, I tried to tell the other nurse.

403
00:21:12,304 --> 00:21:14,716
- He wasn't in the explosion.
- Okay.

404
00:21:14,741 --> 00:21:16,993
- Tell me what happened.
- Uhm...

405
00:21:17,605 --> 00:21:20,948
The paramedics brought
him here because he...

406
00:21:21,254 --> 00:21:23,993
He OD'd. And I gave him naloxone,

407
00:21:24,018 --> 00:21:26,306
but I think that maybe it was too late.

408
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:28,415
And no one is telling me anything so...

409
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,872
What's your boyfriend's name?

410
00:21:29,897 --> 00:21:31,416
Chris Hewitt.

411
00:21:31,663 --> 00:21:32,876
And yours?

412
00:21:33,275 --> 00:21:34,542
Alexia.

413
00:21:34,567 --> 00:21:36,501
Alexia. My name is Claire.

414
00:21:36,534 --> 00:21:38,334
I'm going to figure out
what happened to him.

415
00:21:38,359 --> 00:21:41,128
That's what the other guy
said and it's been forever.

416
00:21:41,153 --> 00:21:43,254
It has been a bit of a
madhouse here today.

417
00:21:43,279 --> 00:21:45,027
And it might take me a bit of time,

418
00:21:45,052 --> 00:21:46,720
but I promise I'll find him, okay?

419
00:21:46,745 --> 00:21:48,485
Just have a seat over here and wait.

420
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,560
Sure you will.

421
00:21:53,930 --> 00:21:55,751
I was prepping him for surgery

422
00:21:55,776 --> 00:21:56,954
when his burns started to develop.

423
00:21:56,979 --> 00:21:58,392
Gavin, you said you
were in the bike shop

424
00:21:58,417 --> 00:21:59,684
when the blast happened?

425
00:21:59,709 --> 00:22:01,488
It felt like the explosion
was right under us.

426
00:22:01,513 --> 00:22:03,312
What sort of chemicals do you use there?

427
00:22:03,337 --> 00:22:05,275
Lots of stuff.

428
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:08,185
Degreaser, mineral
spirits, rust remover...

429
00:22:08,210 --> 00:22:10,955
- Rust remover?
- Yeah. We use it all the time.

430
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:14,651
Hydrofluoric acid. It's used to
strip rust, among other things.

431
00:22:14,676 --> 00:22:16,109
It can take some time to present.

432
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:18,790
It's easily neutralized with a
solution of calcium gluconate.

433
00:22:18,815 --> 00:22:20,243
If it was localized to the shop

434
00:22:20,268 --> 00:22:22,402
that will explain why we
haven’t see more burns.

435
00:22:22,427 --> 00:22:24,191
I wasn't there alone, Dr. Hamed.

436
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:27,014
Excuse me.

437
00:22:29,044 --> 00:22:30,744
This just came on now?

438
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:32,477
When I woke up.

439
00:22:32,831 --> 00:22:34,604
(GRUNTING)

440
00:22:34,629 --> 00:22:37,236
You must have been in closer
proximity than Gavin.

441
00:22:37,261 --> 00:22:39,693
It's in my lungs?

442
00:22:40,579 --> 00:22:43,571
(COUGHING)

443
00:22:47,269 --> 00:22:49,202
Aerosolized particles.

444
00:22:49,924 --> 00:22:52,241
We can do a procedure
called a lung lavage.

445
00:22:52,266 --> 00:22:54,283
It flushes out the
chemicals from your lungs.

446
00:22:54,308 --> 00:22:56,276
(WHEEZING)

447
00:22:56,301 --> 00:22:58,269
Take slow breaths for me.

448
00:22:58,386 --> 00:23:00,073
(WHEEZING)

449
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,341
It's an internal hematoma which
is now swelling quickly.

450
00:23:03,366 --> 00:23:06,011
A blast injury? Arterial?

451
00:23:06,036 --> 00:23:07,351
<i>A venous collection.</i>

452
00:23:07,376 --> 00:23:09,931
And it aggravated when
the elevator stopped.

453
00:23:10,228 --> 00:23:13,586
Dr. Bishop, if it's
pressing on her airway...

454
00:23:17,875 --> 00:23:19,523
(GASPS)

455
00:23:19,735 --> 00:23:21,502
<i>How long until somebody can get us out?</i>

456
00:23:21,579 --> 00:23:23,022
When the power came back on,

457
00:23:23,047 --> 00:23:25,515
the surge blew part of our grid.

458
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,789
We've got two elevators down,

459
00:23:26,814 --> 00:23:28,381
but only yours was in use at the time.

460
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:30,390
Mechanical's working
with fire and rescue,

461
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:34,039
but you're between floors,
so it's delicate.

462
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:37,906
Sir, if the swelling continues

463
00:23:37,931 --> 00:23:39,867
we lose our shot at intubating her.

464
00:23:39,892 --> 00:23:43,461
You need to be prepared to
act before that happens.

465
00:23:43,487 --> 00:23:46,801
<i>You mean, open an
airway without imaging?</i>

466
00:23:47,915 --> 00:23:50,218
Sir, even if I could
approximate an incision point,

467
00:23:50,243 --> 00:23:51,515
I don't have the proper tools.

468
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:53,031
Well, let's hope it
doesn't come to that.

469
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:54,828
How fast is the swelling accelerating?

470
00:23:54,853 --> 00:23:56,484
It's doubled in the last nine minutes.

471
00:23:56,509 --> 00:23:58,320
Well, if it keeps accelerating
at the same rate,

472
00:23:58,345 --> 00:24:00,357
you won't have another nine minutes.

473
00:24:02,771 --> 00:24:04,471
(GASPS)

474
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,111
If I don't make it,

475
00:24:06,136 --> 00:24:08,906
I need you to tell Jules...

476
00:24:09,502 --> 00:24:13,232
If I knew this morning was
gonna be the last time...

477
00:24:13,962 --> 00:24:17,581
Please, tell her that I love her.

478
00:24:17,606 --> 00:24:19,874
- No.
- What?

479
00:24:19,899 --> 00:24:21,633
I'm not gonna tell your
wife you love her.

480
00:24:21,658 --> 00:24:22,963
Because you will.

481
00:24:23,042 --> 00:24:24,509
You will.

482
00:24:24,534 --> 00:24:25,875
Do we have an ETA on doctor Singh?

483
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,593
He's on OR4 with a thoracotomy.

484
00:24:27,618 --> 00:24:29,886
He's going to be out for
at least ten more minutes.

485
00:24:29,911 --> 00:24:31,085
Who else is on?

486
00:24:31,110 --> 00:24:33,397
All the ORs are active right now.
We're it.

487
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:34,555
He's getting worse.

488
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,405
We're losing circulation
to the herniated bowel.

489
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,730
We're gonna have to go in.

490
00:24:37,755 --> 00:24:39,823
Without Singh? Dr. Curtis...

491
00:24:39,848 --> 00:24:42,389
If we lose blood flow, the
bowel will become ischemic.

492
00:24:42,635 --> 00:24:45,360
It could cause severe damage.
I have to go in.

493
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,237
Scalpel.

494
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:05,828
Please.

495
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:08,491
May I?

496
00:25:13,536 --> 00:25:16,860
So we're slowly bringing your
daughter's temperature back up.

497
00:25:16,981 --> 00:25:18,368
I can't stand this.

498
00:25:18,393 --> 00:25:19,967
Not knowing.

499
00:25:21,122 --> 00:25:23,287
It shouldn't be too much longer now.

500
00:25:23,926 --> 00:25:25,927
There must be something you can tell me.

501
00:25:25,952 --> 00:25:27,154
Chances? Statistics?

502
00:25:27,179 --> 00:25:29,487
I can't just sit here in the dark.

503
00:25:32,644 --> 00:25:35,451
Gabby walks home from school on her own.

504
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:39,914
If I'd finished work early
and come to pick her up...

505
00:25:39,961 --> 00:25:41,396
Elena...

506
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,710
This is not your fault.

507
00:25:45,293 --> 00:25:47,593
I had the option to work
from home this year

508
00:25:47,618 --> 00:25:49,215
and I didn't take it.

509
00:25:50,066 --> 00:25:51,802
And if you did pick her up?

510
00:25:52,714 --> 00:25:54,970
You could both be lying here.

511
00:25:57,936 --> 00:26:00,310
I'm never letting her walk home again.

512
00:26:02,942 --> 00:26:06,211
I bet you Gabby wouldn't be as
keen on that idea as you are.

513
00:26:06,244 --> 00:26:08,623
(LAUGHS)

514
00:26:09,285 --> 00:26:11,904
She's always been so stubborn.

515
00:26:13,643 --> 00:26:16,678
I'll come get you as soon
as there's news. Okay?

516
00:26:17,455 --> 00:26:18,954
Thank you.

517
00:26:36,163 --> 00:26:39,833
All I need to do is make
an incision distally.

518
00:26:40,065 --> 00:26:42,240
I'll quickly insert a tube.

519
00:26:42,265 --> 00:26:43,373
Dr. Leblanc.

520
00:26:43,398 --> 00:26:45,348
<i>Poor hemostatic technique
can increase the risk...</i>

521
00:26:45,373 --> 00:26:46,463
<i>(BISHOP): Mags.</i>

522
00:26:46,488 --> 00:26:48,170
<i>To be careful to apply pressure...</i>

523
00:26:48,195 --> 00:26:50,526
- Mags!
- What?

524
00:26:50,551 --> 00:26:53,310
(BISHOP): Where do you spend
every waking moment of your day?

525
00:26:53,662 --> 00:26:55,138
In this hospital?

526
00:26:55,163 --> 00:26:57,700
Exactly. And when you're not
here, what are you doing?

527
00:26:57,725 --> 00:26:58,925
Reading.

528
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:00,553
<i>Reading what?</i>

529
00:27:01,937 --> 00:27:03,372
Medical textbooks.

530
00:27:03,546 --> 00:27:05,847
<i>I've read three studies
on this procedure</i>

531
00:27:05,872 --> 00:27:08,294
and I've watched every
video available online.

532
00:27:10,027 --> 00:27:13,105
You're the one always telling me not
to overthink, but I'm ready for this

533
00:27:13,130 --> 00:27:15,323
<i>because... because of
all the work I've done.</i>

534
00:27:15,348 --> 00:27:16,615
I agree.

535
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,873
You do?

536
00:27:18,411 --> 00:27:21,206
If I was stuck in an
elevator <i>with a hematoma,</i>

You were able to re-assemble
the edges without tension.

Yeah. I used running silk

morbidity from the procedure?

No risk for complications.

should have waited...

perform that procedure alone

00:38:52,013 --> 00:38:53,813
That was a tough day.

719
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,877
I know you're all exhausted.

720
00:39:01,347 --> 00:39:04,801
We weren't perfect, but we came through.

721
00:39:06,328 --> 00:39:09,055
What we do here is about
more than being perfect.

722
00:39:09,169 --> 00:39:12,267
It's about showing up, no
matter how we're tested,

723
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,811
and leaving everything on the floor.

724
00:39:15,948 --> 00:39:17,983
That's what we do every day.

725
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:21,317
And nothing makes me more
proud than knowing that.

726
00:39:25,758 --> 00:39:27,366
Now get back to work.

727
00:39:55,214 --> 00:39:56,447
Hey.

728
00:39:58,973 --> 00:40:00,173
Hey.

729
00:40:10,997 --> 00:40:14,111
There's a Gift card for the
grocery store down the street.

730
00:40:14,136 --> 00:40:16,206
They have hot meals too.

731
00:40:18,307 --> 00:40:21,225
There's also the name and
address of a woman's shelter.

732
00:40:21,669 --> 00:40:24,005
Our social worker called ahead,

733
00:40:24,154 --> 00:40:25,954
they have a bed waiting for you.

734
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:29,515
All you have to do is show up.

735
00:40:35,417 --> 00:40:37,519
Why are you doing this?

736
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:40,856
I ran away when I was fifteen.

737
00:40:41,868 --> 00:40:44,108
It's never too late to start again.

738
00:40:47,697 --> 00:40:50,199
(SIGHS) I'm here most days.

739
00:40:51,135 --> 00:40:53,660
You need anything, you come back.

740
00:41:20,107 --> 00:41:22,726
I bet you do something
like this every day

741
00:41:22,751 --> 00:41:24,517
and no one ever notices.

742
00:41:24,624 --> 00:41:28,070
Look at you, so sentimental today.

743
00:41:28,178 --> 00:41:30,179
(CHUCKLING)

744
00:41:46,205 --> 00:41:47,882
How are you feeling, Gavin?

745
00:41:48,263 --> 00:41:50,174
I talked to the nurses.

746
00:41:52,869 --> 00:41:55,389
Four people died in that explosion.

747
00:41:55,830 --> 00:41:58,267
I was there. You did
everything you could.

748
00:42:00,303 --> 00:42:03,771
Those people that didn't
make it, you have to...

749
00:42:05,374 --> 00:42:07,568
You have to try and let that go.

750
00:42:11,171 --> 00:42:12,753
Yeah.

751
00:42:24,863 --> 00:42:27,565
(MUFFLED GUNFIRE)

752
00:42:27,805 --> 00:42:30,807
(BEEPING)
