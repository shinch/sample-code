She's jaundiced.

178

I'd be concerned with liver injury.

179

Yeah, but those symptoms could
also describe biliary colic?

acute liver failure.

We should do testing to confirm.

Given her level of consciousness,

184

I'd suggest an aggressive approach.

Intubation sooner rather than later.

She could go into
multiple organ failure.

He couldn't get his

at a university lab.
