1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:04,498
My university might never release
my medical school transcripts.

2
00:00:04,523 --> 00:00:06,498
But sir, I am the doctor
I told you I was.

3
00:00:06,523 --> 00:00:09,098
I'm here about your former
colleague, Khaled Abdullah.

4
00:00:09,123 --> 00:00:11,624
Mr. Abdullah is wanted for
an immigration violation.

5
00:00:11,649 --> 00:00:13,639
So if you see him, call me.

6
00:00:38,048 --> 00:00:39,743
Bashir. Bashir.

7
00:00:40,393 --> 00:00:41,725
Khaled.

8
00:00:42,606 --> 00:00:44,439
Everything alright?

9
00:00:45,454 --> 00:00:47,344
I have these for you.

10
00:00:51,897 --> 00:00:53,496
Transcripts?

11
00:00:56,091 --> 00:00:58,091
I thought you were just
going to look into them.

12
00:00:58,116 --> 00:01:00,074
My friend said they
were easy to reproduce.

13
00:01:00,099 --> 00:01:02,480
So I told him just go ahead.

14
00:01:04,298 --> 00:01:07,071
Forgeries, corruption. That
was supposed to be behind us.

15
00:01:07,096 --> 00:01:09,115
These are your grades, brother.

16
00:01:09,140 --> 00:01:10,711
You earned them.

17
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:13,133
Who cares where the paper comes from.

18
00:01:14,025 --> 00:01:15,911
Did you pay him for these?

19
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:28,243
Yeah, they were asking about
you at the hospital as well

20
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:31,461
- Did you tell them where I was?
- Of course not.

21
00:01:34,578 --> 00:01:37,094
My claim for asylum was denied.

22
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,930
Can you appeal? What
if you got a lawyer?

23
00:01:49,125 --> 00:01:52,364
Can I stay with you just 'til
I figure out what to do?

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:57,344
If it was just me, it
would be different.

25
00:01:57,541 --> 00:02:01,497
But I have Amira to consider,
and if we were caught...

26
00:02:02,636 --> 00:02:04,334
I understand.

27
00:02:09,911 --> 00:02:11,673
I'm working overnight.

28
00:02:11,698 --> 00:02:13,098
Amira's with a neighbour.

29
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,351
Thank you. I'll leave at dawn.

30
00:02:15,376 --> 00:02:17,360
Your sister will never know I was there.

31
00:02:17,771 --> 00:02:19,612
And use the transcripts, Bashir.

32
00:02:19,822 --> 00:02:21,852
Nobody needs to know.

33
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:41,907
Intra-nasal foreign body removal.

34
00:02:42,056 --> 00:02:45,048
- Interesting new hobby.
- Yeah. Jealous?

35
00:02:45,073 --> 00:02:47,073
I'm almost done if you
want to borrow it.

36
00:02:47,098 --> 00:02:49,290
Uh, no time, I'm headed
home for the night.

37
00:02:49,315 --> 00:02:52,397
Ugh. Eight hours of driving
for one day at home.

38
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,032
Huh, somebody's hard up...

39
00:02:54,057 --> 00:02:56,231
It's Abby's piano recital tomorrow.

40
00:02:56,256 --> 00:02:59,104
And Melissa lets the girls sleep
in our bed when I'm gone,

41
00:02:59,129 --> 00:03:01,586
so that won't be happening.

42
00:03:02,124 --> 00:03:04,476
- Worth it to be with your family.
- Yeah.

43
00:03:04,713 --> 00:03:06,548
Amira, she spending the night solo?

44
00:03:06,573 --> 00:03:08,047
Amira? Girlfriend? Daughter?

45
00:03:08,072 --> 00:03:10,930
My younger sister. She's
with the neighbours.

46
00:03:13,641 --> 00:03:15,652
Dr. Hamed, by any chance,
do you speak Urdu?

47
00:03:15,677 --> 00:03:18,020
No. But I think my
great-grandmother did.

48
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,610
Call the translator.

49
00:03:19,635 --> 00:03:21,454
Do you see non-surgical patients too?

50
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,922
Only when it's busy, which is always,

51
00:03:22,947 --> 00:03:24,946
unless my surgical attending
needs me upstairs.

52
00:03:24,971 --> 00:03:26,961
Imagine they paid us by the patient?

53
00:03:27,066 --> 00:03:29,157
What is the pay schedule here?

54
00:03:29,182 --> 00:03:31,127
- Every third Thursday.
- When I first started,

55
00:03:31,152 --> 00:03:33,032
it took 'em four weeks to
get me on the payroll.

56
00:03:33,057 --> 00:03:34,680
Any chance they've gotten faster?

57
00:03:34,705 --> 00:03:36,563
Do you guys know a doctor?

58
00:03:36,572 --> 00:03:38,392
Dr. Hamed will take you to triage.

59
00:03:38,417 --> 00:03:41,848
Actually Dr. Curtis will. Dr.
Hamed and I need a word.

60
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:46,438
Legal's up in arms about
your missing transcripts.

61
00:03:46,463 --> 00:03:49,024
They won't accept that you can't
get the originals out of Aleppo.

62
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:51,528
Any chance they watched the
news in the past five years?

63
00:03:51,553 --> 00:03:52,743
Apparently not.

64
00:03:52,768 --> 00:03:55,181
They want to see you
before making a decision.

65
00:03:55,206 --> 00:03:56,985
- A decision?
- Render judgment?

66
00:03:57,010 --> 00:03:59,646
Call it what you will. They've
asked to talk to you tomorrow.

67
00:03:59,671 --> 00:04:01,825
Anything in particular
they want to know?

68
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:03,276
About the Syrian doctor

69
00:04:03,301 --> 00:04:05,463
who showed up out of nowhere
wielding a power drill.

70
00:04:05,488 --> 00:04:07,373
I think they're gonna
want to know everything.

71
00:04:07,951 --> 00:04:10,863
To them, you're just a giant
flashing neon sign that reads:

72
00:04:10,888 --> 00:04:13,137
Liability. Do not proceed.

73
00:04:13,514 --> 00:04:15,181
Tomorrow, 6pm,

74
00:04:15,206 --> 00:04:17,238
and wear the kind of tie you wear

75
00:04:17,263 --> 00:04:19,176
when your entire future
hangs in the balance.

76
00:04:19,201 --> 00:04:20,834
Heading home, Dr. Bishop?

77
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:22,503
Well, I can always stick around...

78
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:23,762
Oh, no we're fine.

79
00:04:23,787 --> 00:04:25,136
You've been here all day.

80
00:04:25,339 --> 00:04:28,560
Wendy loves it when I insert
myself and disrupt her shifts.

81
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:31,527
I still remember when 36-hour
shifts were the expectation.

82
00:04:31,552 --> 00:04:32,591
That's how I trained.

83
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:35,480
Turns out we function
better when we're awake.

84
00:04:35,505 --> 00:04:37,902
Well, have fun tonight, people.

85
00:04:39,984 --> 00:04:42,886
What happened with the
Blakemore can't happen again.

86
00:04:43,026 --> 00:04:45,537
I'm aware you have
skills and experience,

87
00:04:45,562 --> 00:04:47,176
but in order for us to move forward,

88
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:50,505
I need to be convinced that
you understand our protocols.

89
00:04:50,530 --> 00:04:51,903
You don't want me seeing patients?

90
00:04:51,928 --> 00:04:54,029
Only the basics. Anything
beyond that, I'm looped in.

91
00:04:54,054 --> 00:04:55,107
Understood?

92
00:04:55,132 --> 00:04:57,654
Cardiac arrest, pulling in now.

93
00:04:58,939 --> 00:05:00,773
Cardiac arrest aren't the basics?

94
00:05:00,798 --> 00:05:02,546
A kid with a fever is.

95
00:05:12,549 --> 00:05:14,733
How long has Tristan been sick?

96
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,715
Well, he had the flu for a couple days,

97
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:19,443
but tonight things just got way worse.

98
00:05:19,468 --> 00:05:20,468
What happened?

99
00:05:20,493 --> 00:05:22,207
He wouldn't drink the
juice that I got him,

100
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:24,324
and then he just stopped answering me

101
00:05:24,499 --> 00:05:27,703
even though his eyes were open.
So I-I don't know.

102
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:31,876
Are your parents around?

103
00:05:31,901 --> 00:05:34,461
Um yeah, my dad, my dad is working.

104
00:05:34,486 --> 00:05:36,332
I called him, but he
didn't answer, so...

105
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:39,465
Temp's 38. BP's 110 over 70.

106
00:05:39,820 --> 00:05:41,871
Let's get his fever
down and put a line in.

107
00:05:41,896 --> 00:05:44,804
IV, fluids, CVC, lytes, CRP.

108
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:49,718
Tristan? Can you hear me?

109
00:05:50,988 --> 00:05:54,051
I gave him a bath to try and
cool him down, but he...

110
00:05:54,185 --> 00:05:55,637
You did all the right things.

111
00:05:55,662 --> 00:05:57,817
It's a good thing you brought him here.

112
00:05:57,854 --> 00:05:59,980
His veins are flat due to dehydration.

113
00:06:00,005 --> 00:06:02,112
It's gonna be tough getting an IV in.

114
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,948
Don't worry, Claire's
an expert with IVs.

115
00:06:05,967 --> 00:06:07,869
You can hold his hand if you want.

116
00:06:07,894 --> 00:06:10,082
Yeah. Okay.

117
00:06:14,154 --> 00:06:18,295
Buddy? The doctors are gonna
help you feel better, okay?

118
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:20,839
Got it.

119
00:06:22,626 --> 00:06:24,478
I'm going to call your father again,

120
00:06:24,503 --> 00:06:27,650
- get him to meet you down here.
- Okay.

121
00:06:28,915 --> 00:06:31,322
Alright, what do we got here?

122
00:06:33,135 --> 00:06:34,830
- You ready?
- Mm-hmm.

123
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,226
Nice. Yeah, we're gonna
have to stitch you up.

124
00:06:41,251 --> 00:06:43,696
We're also gonna need a serum
tox with an alcohol level.

125
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,642
- Yup.
- We... We were not drinking

126
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:50,025
That's why it reeks like beer in here.

127
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,861
What's your name?

128
00:06:54,886 --> 00:06:56,486
Well, what's yours?

129
00:06:56,511 --> 00:06:59,212
Did you, did you wanna have
dinner with me sometime?

130
00:06:59,861 --> 00:07:01,634
His name is Brett.

131
00:07:01,659 --> 00:07:04,595
He got hit in the head
with a lacrosse stick.

132
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,970
Alright, Brett, follow my finger.

133
00:07:06,995 --> 00:07:08,837
So you guys like to
play lacrosse at night?

134
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:09,863
Open your mouth.

135
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:11,689
No, it's actually pledge week, so we...

136
00:07:11,714 --> 00:07:14,618
Wait. Dude, that's not gonna
hurt my chances, right?

137
00:07:14,643 --> 00:07:16,673
Dude, dude, shut up. You took a vow!

138
00:07:16,698 --> 00:07:18,650
Uh, you took a head wound
to get into a frat?

139
00:07:18,675 --> 00:07:22,025
I'm already in. I just...
caught a backswing by accident.

140
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:25,228
I definitely would've taken that
hit if it meant I'd get in.

141
00:07:25,253 --> 00:07:28,023
You geniuses do realize that even a
minor head wound can be dangerous,

142
00:07:28,048 --> 00:07:30,954
especially when combined
with drugs and or alcohol?

143
00:07:30,979 --> 00:07:33,259
I told you, we weren't drinking.

144
00:07:33,284 --> 00:07:35,580
We're a holistic frat.

145
00:07:35,605 --> 00:07:37,579
No booze. No drugs.

146
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:40,470
We even meditate.

147
00:07:40,495 --> 00:07:43,798
Well, you seem very enlightened.
I'll be back.

148
00:07:45,602 --> 00:07:47,677
Oh, shit.

149
00:07:55,255 --> 00:07:56,783
Oh!

150
00:07:57,961 --> 00:08:00,017
Last night was fun.

151
00:08:01,487 --> 00:08:04,228
You gonna hold the door for me too?

152
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:08,868
You're welcome.

153
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,291
Hi. I'm Doctor Leblanc. What
seems to be the problem today?

154
00:08:15,316 --> 00:08:17,135
I don't know why I'm here.

155
00:08:17,309 --> 00:08:20,293
I'm not hurt, as far as I can tell.

156
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:23,351
Okay, uh, what is the
last thing you remember?

157
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,228
They told me a cab driver brought me in.

158
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:28,468
But I remember where I
took the cab, or why.

159
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:30,531
I don't even know my own name.

160
00:08:30,556 --> 00:08:34,091
And you don't have any ID on you?
Wallet, phone?

161
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:38,269
I don't know the password to unlock it.

162
00:08:38,294 --> 00:08:40,994
What kind of person leaves
their house without a wallet?

163
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:44,108
Okay. Um, look at my finger.

164
00:08:49,632 --> 00:08:51,763
Well, doesn't seem like
you've been drinking.

165
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:54,450
In any other case, I'd take
a complete medical history,

166
00:08:54,475 --> 00:08:56,505
but obviously that's not an option.

167
00:08:56,653 --> 00:08:59,154
Do you have any idea why
this is happening to me?

168
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,647
Uh, head trauma, even mild,
can cause memory loss,

169
00:09:02,672 --> 00:09:05,622
but your pupils aren't dilated,
so concussion's unlikely.

170
00:09:05,647 --> 00:09:09,132
Could be lifestyle related. A
substance you ingested, maybe

171
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,303
Do you think you can help me?

172
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,661
Yeah, well, we'll run some tests,

173
00:09:14,686 --> 00:09:16,384
and narrow down the diagnoses.

174
00:09:16,409 --> 00:09:19,143
If anything comes back
to you, you let us know.

175
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:25,849
I wasn't home when they brought him in.

176
00:09:25,874 --> 00:09:27,863
Max was worried. He's a
great older brother,

177
00:09:27,888 --> 00:09:30,114
but sometimes he's a
little overprotective.

178
00:09:30,139 --> 00:09:31,513
What, I wasn't...

179
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:33,438
Dad, you know he's really sick, right?

180
00:09:33,463 --> 00:09:36,787
Dr. Hamed, this is Jared Abott.

181
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:38,622
He would like to take his son home.

182
00:09:38,647 --> 00:09:40,248
- Where's his fever?
- 39 now.

183
00:09:40,273 --> 00:09:41,287
That's up from before.

184
00:09:41,312 --> 00:09:43,028
Sir, taking him home is not a good idea.

185
00:09:43,053 --> 00:09:45,209
He's been unresponsive
and has a high fever.

186
00:09:45,234 --> 00:09:46,591
We need to give him antibiotics.

187
00:09:46,616 --> 00:09:48,386
How do we know the fever
isn't a reaction to

188
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:50,007
something that you have given him here?

189
00:09:50,032 --> 00:09:51,708
- Dad, no, I...
- He had a fever before

190
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,192
I took him in. That's why he's here.

191
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,544
I don't want him taking
unnecessary drugs.

192
00:09:55,569 --> 00:09:57,073
Tristan doesn't react well to them.

193
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:58,896
How would you know? You
never give him any.

194
00:09:58,921 --> 00:10:01,393
Sir, this could be more
than a simple flu.

195
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:04,333
We don't know what's causing
your son's fever to spike.

196
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:06,190
It could be a serious infection.

197
00:10:08,192 --> 00:10:10,029
- He's not vaccinated.
- Max!

198
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:11,738
They have to know, Dad!

199
00:10:11,763 --> 00:10:14,763
- Is that true?
- Which vaccinations is he missing?

200
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:18,286
All of them.

201
00:10:33,104 --> 00:10:38,325
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

202
00:10:40,986 --> 00:10:44,055
We must shift Tristan Abbot in
negative pressure isolation.

203
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,783
Gloves, gowns, masks on
everyone, staff or family,

204
00:10:46,808 --> 00:10:48,641
until we know what he has.

205
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:49,900
You're back?

206
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:52,944
Unvaccinated child with
a mystery illness?

207
00:10:53,006 --> 00:10:55,642
More interesting than my flat screen.

208
00:10:55,667 --> 00:10:57,061
I know that look.

209
00:10:57,086 --> 00:10:59,267
She's already writing
a paper in her head.

210
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:01,195
So, what's the case?

211
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:02,330
Seemingly healthy male,

212
00:11:02,355 --> 00:11:05,056
no idea who he is and no
ability to retain new memories

213
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,980
Think it could be
Transient Global Amnesia?

214
00:11:07,005 --> 00:11:10,000
- What about a concussion?
- No headache, dizziness, nausea.

215
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:11,540
No evidence of a fall or head trauma.

216
00:11:11,565 --> 00:11:14,744
Order a tox screen and CT just to
rule out anything more serious.

217
00:11:14,769 --> 00:11:15,946
He's out for both right now.

218
00:11:15,971 --> 00:11:18,638
Usually with TGA, a patient
still knows their name.

219
00:11:18,663 --> 00:11:20,728
Well, studies show some
cases are more acute.

220
00:11:20,753 --> 00:11:23,557
Could even be brought on by stress.
So should I call neurology?

221
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,831
No, they'll only come down
if the CT shows something.

222
00:11:25,856 --> 00:11:28,276
With TGA, we're told to just
wait until he remembers,

223
00:11:28,301 --> 00:11:29,901
or someone comes looking for him.

224
00:11:29,926 --> 00:11:32,169
The Abbott boy's fever is still holding.

225
00:11:32,194 --> 00:11:34,322
The father wants to know
when we're discharging him.

226
00:11:34,347 --> 00:11:35,580
Of course he does.

227
00:11:35,884 --> 00:11:37,783
Get set up for the lumbar puncture.

228
00:11:37,883 --> 00:11:40,118
With your permission, I'd like to do it.

229
00:11:41,106 --> 00:11:42,391
I will do it.

230
00:11:42,477 --> 00:11:46,290
Page me when you're ready.
Get to work, both of you.

231
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,792
Most first year don't get to do
spinal on their third shift.

232
00:11:51,817 --> 00:11:54,564
I may be a first year here, but
this is not my third shift.

233
00:11:54,604 --> 00:11:56,004
Okay.

234
00:11:57,086 --> 00:11:59,469
Do you see a lot of
unvaccinated children?

235
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,926
More than we should.

236
00:12:00,951 --> 00:12:03,197
People afraid of side
effects, primarily autism.

237
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:05,195
That study was retracted.

238
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,597
Yeah, and a tonne of misinformation
is taking its place.

239
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:10,491
Are there antivaxxers in Syria?

240
00:12:11,071 --> 00:12:13,632
People there are desperate for vaccines.

241
00:12:13,657 --> 00:12:16,236
We fight to get them into the country.

242
00:12:19,581 --> 00:12:21,831
The spinal needles
you're giving Tristan...

243
00:12:21,856 --> 00:12:24,613
Explain to me why you have to do this.

244
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:27,136
We need to rule out
life-threatening infections

245
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:29,050
like meningitis or encephalitis.

246
00:12:29,075 --> 00:12:31,220
And the blood tests you've
already done can't do that?

247
00:12:31,245 --> 00:12:33,370
There's a limit to what
blood work can tell us.

248
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:34,612
Is it going to hurt him?

249
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:36,926
We'll freeze up the skin
to minimize any pain,

250
00:12:36,951 --> 00:12:38,862
and make sure it's over
as quickly as possible.

251
00:12:39,193 --> 00:12:42,138
Max got one vaccination
when he was a baby.

252
00:12:42,712 --> 00:12:44,381
It left him paralyzed for a week.

253
00:12:44,406 --> 00:12:45,941
Half his little face was frozen.

254
00:12:45,966 --> 00:12:48,667
Reactions like that are rare,
and almost never serious.

255
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:50,226
Until they are.

256
00:12:50,251 --> 00:12:51,717
We were lucky that he bounced back.

257
00:12:51,742 --> 00:12:53,519
After that, we were done with it.

258
00:12:53,885 --> 00:12:55,984
The body builds its own immunity.

259
00:12:57,055 --> 00:12:59,821
Then neither of your
sons are vaccinated?

260
00:13:00,769 --> 00:13:03,011
Mr. Abbott. We only
want to help your son.

261
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:06,078
We'll be as non-invasive
as we can moving forward.

262
00:13:07,384 --> 00:13:09,279
Their mother was a natural with this.

263
00:13:09,304 --> 00:13:13,502
Together, we got Max through
colds, flus, even measles.

264
00:13:13,842 --> 00:13:16,796
We lost her suddenly in a car accident.

265
00:13:18,537 --> 00:13:20,420
Tristan wouldn't even remember her.

266
00:13:20,445 --> 00:13:22,011
I'm sorry to hear that.

267
00:13:26,859 --> 00:13:28,886
Is everything ready, Dr. Hamed?

268
00:13:28,911 --> 00:13:31,816
- Mm-hm.
- I'll insert the spinal needle.

269
00:13:52,432 --> 00:13:54,430
Hello. I'm Dr. Leblanc.

270
00:13:54,455 --> 00:13:56,987
A taxi brought you in and you
couldn't remember who you are.

271
00:13:57,012 --> 00:13:59,019
And we've already met.

272
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:02,551
How can I not remember a
single thing about myself?

273
00:14:02,786 --> 00:14:04,784
Well, we do know a few things.

274
00:14:04,809 --> 00:14:07,715
Your imaging and blood work aren't
showing any significant abnormalities.

275
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:10,191
So we know you're basically healthy.

276
00:14:10,473 --> 00:14:12,300
There's no pill you can give me?

277
00:14:12,325 --> 00:14:14,881
Jar my brain into recalling some facts?

278
00:14:14,906 --> 00:14:16,237
I wish there was.

279
00:14:16,378 --> 00:14:17,911
Give me your arm.

280
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,414
That's quite a scar.

281
00:14:22,336 --> 00:14:23,722
Huh.

282
00:14:23,747 --> 00:14:25,347
It's weird...

283
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:29,744
A stranger putting your life
under the microscope this way.

284
00:14:30,290 --> 00:14:33,039
Well, how about we widen the field?

285
00:14:33,235 --> 00:14:36,535
- You can cross-examine mine.
- Are you serious?

286
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:39,645
Okay. Um...

287
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,173
Young doctor starting out?

288
00:14:43,054 --> 00:14:45,188
Entry level BMW,

289
00:14:45,328 --> 00:14:47,370
a tiny perfect condo

290
00:14:47,395 --> 00:14:48,661
and, uh...

291
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,933
and a couple cats you
rescued from the shelter.

292
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:53,409
Couple cats? Now I'm offended.

293
00:14:54,461 --> 00:14:56,361
I still live in my studio walk-up.

294
00:14:56,386 --> 00:14:58,164
Turn around for me please?

295
00:14:58,943 --> 00:15:01,139
You don't want to put down roots?

296
00:15:01,164 --> 00:15:03,297
I'd rather spend on experiences.

297
00:15:03,406 --> 00:15:05,698
Live while there's time.

298
00:15:07,967 --> 00:15:09,434
Toussez deux fois?

299
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:13,789
Well, we just found
out you speak French.

300
00:15:14,476 --> 00:15:15,808
- I do?
- Yeah.

301
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,127
You responded to my
request, en français.

302
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,422
The only thing you need to know
about me is that I don't give up.

303
00:15:22,681 --> 00:15:24,632
And I love my car.

304
00:15:35,309 --> 00:15:36,876
Hey.

305
00:15:38,695 --> 00:15:40,148
So, uh...

306
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:42,734
Couple more hours, then we
can release your friend.

307
00:15:43,939 --> 00:15:46,578
Is there anyone you can
call to wait with him?

308
00:15:46,603 --> 00:15:48,039
You could go home.

309
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:50,680
No one even supposed to
know what we're doing,

310
00:15:50,705 --> 00:15:53,453
so if I leave then I'll never get in.

311
00:15:54,891 --> 00:15:56,977
Ethan.

312
00:15:57,320 --> 00:15:59,938
I mean, is it... is it really
worth demeaning yourself

313
00:15:59,963 --> 00:16:04,406
just to be accepted by a
collection of entitled assholes?

314
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:08,047
I'm here on scholarship, and...

315
00:16:08,183 --> 00:16:10,359
half the alumni get the
kind of finance jobs

316
00:16:10,384 --> 00:16:12,514
I want after business school, so...

317
00:16:13,297 --> 00:16:15,433
Yeah. It is.

318
00:16:30,599 --> 00:16:33,912
Wow. You'll really take
any excuse, won't you?

319
00:16:34,064 --> 00:16:35,443
You're not happy to see me?

320
00:16:35,468 --> 00:16:38,402
You need to be able to trust your staff.

321
00:16:38,427 --> 00:16:41,505
I do. I only hire the best.

322
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,394
Then why are you back here instead
of getting the rest you need?

323
00:16:44,419 --> 00:16:46,581
Sound of an empty house
is too loud for you?

324
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:50,987
It's my department, Claire. I
can come and go as I please.

325
00:16:51,012 --> 00:16:53,315
But it's touching that
you worry about me.

326
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:55,925
I'm too busy to worry about you.

327
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,772
Can't decide?

328
00:17:03,392 --> 00:17:05,558
My dad says it's all chemicals.

329
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,878
He may have a point about that.

330
00:17:08,783 --> 00:17:10,483
He's not happy with me.

331
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:12,178
I know.

332
00:17:12,847 --> 00:17:16,077
But you did the right thing
by telling us about Tristan.

333
00:17:17,407 --> 00:17:19,140
You know, he...

334
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,532
He talks about getting
me through measles...

335
00:17:22,347 --> 00:17:25,281
as if him and my mom were heroes.

336
00:17:26,577 --> 00:17:28,944
You know? But it wasn't
like that for me.

337
00:17:28,969 --> 00:17:30,335
At all.

338
00:17:30,487 --> 00:17:32,253
I never told them, but I...

339
00:17:32,278 --> 00:17:34,972
I was so afraid that I was gonna die.

340
00:17:36,259 --> 00:17:38,476
And, I don't know...

341
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:40,769
You know, after my mom...

342
00:17:41,522 --> 00:17:43,939
it's just gotten even harder
to talk to him, so...

343
00:17:52,215 --> 00:17:54,532
I won't tell if you won't.

344
00:18:02,786 --> 00:18:05,550
Theo, I thought you
were with your family.

345
00:18:05,575 --> 00:18:07,284
Made it halfway home.

346
00:18:07,309 --> 00:18:10,933
Atwater wants all her
pediatric resources close by.

347
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:15,074
Well, I guess she just doesn't trust me.

348
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:17,665
You mind taking a listen to that?

349
00:18:20,536 --> 00:18:22,369
Onset of stridor, right?

350
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:25,439
It's faint but it's definitely there.

351
00:18:26,462 --> 00:18:28,483
Open his mouth.

352
00:18:35,948 --> 00:18:39,212
- Whoa, that's...
- a pseudo-membrane.

353
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:41,621
If it grows, it could
obstruct his airway.

354
00:18:41,646 --> 00:18:43,081
Diphtheria.

355
00:18:43,106 --> 00:18:45,572
- I didn't think that existed here.
- It shouldn't.

356
00:18:45,597 --> 00:18:47,878
There have been two or three
cases in the past decade,

357
00:18:47,903 --> 00:18:49,222
but it's extremely rare.

358
00:18:49,247 --> 00:18:50,769
- I've never seen it.
- I have.

359
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:52,637
And even people with
immunity can be carriers

360
00:18:52,662 --> 00:18:54,308
We need to start treatment now.

361
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:55,542
There's an antitoxin.

362
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:57,554
Which we don't stock due to vaccines.

363
00:18:57,712 --> 00:18:59,889
I'll get someone from
Public Health on the phone

364
00:18:59,914 --> 00:19:01,481
but they'll have to mix a compound.

365
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,931
It's unlikely we'll get anything
until tomorrow afternoon.

366
00:19:03,954 --> 00:19:05,104
Do we have that long?

367
00:19:05,129 --> 00:19:08,175
If the membrane is already forming,
his airway will be compromised.

368
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,620
We'll watch him closely and
keep pushing antibiotics.

369
00:19:10,645 --> 00:19:13,386
'Til then, we just need to
keep him hydrated and on O2.

370
00:19:13,594 --> 00:19:15,300
We need to inform the father.

371
00:19:15,325 --> 00:19:17,761
He's put this whole ward at risk.

372
00:19:21,015 --> 00:19:22,573
Alright, field trip's over.

373
00:19:22,598 --> 00:19:24,683
If you vomit, come back. If
you're dizzy, come back.

374
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,594
No alcohol, mm?

375
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:28,119
And no sports.

376
00:19:28,562 --> 00:19:30,144
And you. Ethan.

377
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,136
You think you can help
him stick to that?

378
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,690
Ethan? You with me buddy?

379
00:19:36,403 --> 00:19:38,472
Ethan? Ethan?

380
00:19:38,497 --> 00:19:41,136
Ethan! You okay?

381
00:19:47,158 --> 00:19:49,417
What did he take, Brett?

382
00:19:51,430 --> 00:19:53,527
I need help over here!

383
00:19:55,858 --> 00:19:58,097
He doesn't have a pulse. We
have to get him to trauma.

384
00:19:58,122 --> 00:20:00,409
On three. One, two, three.

385
00:20:05,029 --> 00:20:08,878
- What did he take, Brett?
- I don't know, I swear!

386
00:20:10,223 --> 00:20:12,230
We have a cardiac arrest!

387
00:20:12,255 --> 00:20:15,729
Claire! Claire, call Atwater.
Get everyone to trauma!

388
00:20:15,754 --> 00:20:17,654
We need Atwater, and we need Leblanc.

389
00:20:19,649 --> 00:20:22,004
We did a tox screen but
only on the injured one.

390
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,940
Let's get a line going. Push epi.

391
00:20:23,965 --> 00:20:25,898
Let me know when you've got a read.

392
00:20:25,923 --> 00:20:28,167
Come on...

393
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,647
Pulse check.

394
00:20:31,553 --> 00:20:32,788
Mm-mm.

395
00:20:32,813 --> 00:20:35,031
He's in V-Fib, we need to defibrillate!

396
00:20:35,056 --> 00:20:36,989
Defib, 200 Jules.

397
00:20:37,099 --> 00:20:38,765
Brett, what did he take?!

398
00:20:38,790 --> 00:20:41,561
- Uh...
- Charging. Pads on.

399
00:20:42,189 --> 00:20:44,280
- Ready.
- Everyone clear!

400
00:20:48,864 --> 00:20:50,329
Resume compressions.

401
00:20:50,514 --> 00:20:53,749
- Brett, what'd he take?!
- It-It wasn't dangerous.

402
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:54,796
One amp epi.

403
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:57,607
Whatever it was, he did it
to impress you, alright?

404
00:20:57,632 --> 00:21:00,301
So if you don't tell us
now, Ethan is gonna die!

405
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:03,507
Soy sauce. He drank soy sauce.

406
00:21:03,532 --> 00:21:05,124
We make all the new pledges do it.

407
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:07,389
If they don't, they get
the lacrosse stick.

408
00:21:07,414 --> 00:21:09,796
Most people just drink a
few sips and take a whack,

409
00:21:09,821 --> 00:21:11,738
but Ethan drank the whole bottle.

410
00:21:11,763 --> 00:21:14,436
- Hypernatremia?
- Made worse by alcohol consumption.

411
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:16,827
The sodium is pulling water
from his organs and his brain.

412
00:21:16,852 --> 00:21:18,552
You can fix him, right?

413
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,124
Start an infusion of D5W.

414
00:21:27,988 --> 00:21:29,988
I'll take over compressions.

415
00:21:35,119 --> 00:21:37,124
Doctor Hamed?

416
00:21:46,803 --> 00:21:48,182
Bash.

417
00:21:53,281 --> 00:21:54,669
Rhythm?

418
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,319
Asystole.

419
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:01,488
Does anyone have any other suggestions
on how to save this patient?

420
00:22:03,175 --> 00:22:05,162
Time, Dr. Curtis.

421
00:22:05,917 --> 00:22:09,745
- Time of death, 4:17 AM.
- What?

422
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:20,350
We can't save them if they
don't tell us what's wrong.

423
00:22:36,607 --> 00:22:38,144
You had a busy night?

424
00:22:38,169 --> 00:22:40,584
We made dinners for the whole week.

425
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:43,470
Hey, can you use your
key, I forgot mine.

426
00:22:50,863 --> 00:22:55,232
Are we going to have to leave?
It says rent past due.

427
00:22:55,334 --> 00:22:57,834
No, no, this is not a big deal, Amira.

428
00:22:57,859 --> 00:22:59,825
What about Pavel's daughter Nadia?

429
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,084
I could offer to babysit.

430
00:23:01,109 --> 00:23:04,146
I've done it before. If we
need money, I can help!

431
00:23:04,218 --> 00:23:06,716
Your job is going to school
and learning English.

432
00:23:06,847 --> 00:23:09,857
Okay? I'll go talk to Pavel right
now and sort it out. Okay?

433
00:23:09,882 --> 00:23:12,309
It's not... Here. Take this.

434
00:23:12,666 --> 00:23:14,561
Go.

435
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:35,046
You could have just talked
to me directly, Pavel.

436
00:23:35,071 --> 00:23:36,482
Amira saw the notice.

437
00:23:36,507 --> 00:23:38,810
Landlord asks me, I ask you.

438
00:23:38,835 --> 00:23:40,419
I just need a little more time.

439
00:23:40,444 --> 00:23:42,638
Who was the stranger with your keys?

440
00:23:42,867 --> 00:23:45,740
Just a friend. I'm allowed
to have visitors.

441
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,803
Visitors come when you're at home.

442
00:23:47,962 --> 00:23:49,805
Your lease is for two people.

443
00:23:50,366 --> 00:23:52,567
Look Bashir, you know I like you. Okay?

444
00:23:52,592 --> 00:23:54,497
I'm just trying to keep
you out of trouble.

445
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:57,104
Okay. You'll have the rent tomorrow.

446
00:24:24,431 --> 00:24:26,813
My brother says it's okay,

447
00:24:26,838 --> 00:24:29,427
but if we have to leave, I
would not see you anymore.

448
00:24:29,763 --> 00:24:31,763
I would miss you.

449
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:36,351
Everything okay in here?

450
00:24:36,376 --> 00:24:39,479
We're fine. You barely slept.

451
00:24:39,504 --> 00:24:43,240
I know. I have to go
back to the hospital.

452
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:45,067
Are you ready to go?

453
00:24:45,562 --> 00:24:48,458
- Hi, Daneesha.
- Hi.

454
00:25:30,185 --> 00:25:32,740
We did everything we
could to save that boy.

455
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,394
I just had to tell that kid's
parents their only son just died

456
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:39,175
trying to get into a frat.

457
00:25:40,773 --> 00:25:43,706
Stupid, meaningless way to die.

458
00:25:43,731 --> 00:25:47,381
It doesn't make it any easier
when they die for a reason.

459
00:25:54,950 --> 00:25:58,508
For those of you just coming
on shift, let me reiterate.

460
00:25:58,533 --> 00:26:00,906
We have an active case of diphtheria

461
00:26:00,931 --> 00:26:03,146
in an unvaccinated child.

462
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:05,508
If you work here, you're
already inoculated.

463
00:26:05,533 --> 00:26:08,275
If someone you know
isn't, they should be.

464
00:26:08,463 --> 00:26:12,016
We're running a vaccination clinic,
Rhoda will have the details.

465
00:26:12,041 --> 00:26:14,367
The child is being kept,
under strict isolation

466
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:16,079
so make sure you follow procedure.

467
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:18,641
If you have had direct
contact, see Claire

468
00:26:18,666 --> 00:26:22,435
for cultures and
prophylactic antibiotics.

469
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:24,141
Dr. Hunter is primary,

470
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:27,437
and Dr. Hamed, who has
actually treated this disease,

471
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:30,594
is a good resource. Make
sure that we use him.

472
00:26:30,619 --> 00:26:32,547
- Yes?
- Mm-hmm.

473
00:26:32,572 --> 00:26:34,133
Alright. Dismissed.

474
00:26:34,588 --> 00:26:36,896
Legal in an hour, you ready?

475
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:54,113
Hmm. What was that for?

476
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:55,837
Nothing.

477
00:26:55,862 --> 00:26:57,666
You sure?

478
00:26:59,929 --> 00:27:01,829
My place later?

479
00:27:17,655 --> 00:27:22,107
Um, if Tristan's awake, could you
just tell him I'm right outside?

480
00:27:24,089 --> 00:27:27,881
I know it must be hard not
being able to help him, but...

481
00:27:28,584 --> 00:27:31,067
Your brother and your
father need you healthy.

482
00:27:35,472 --> 00:27:39,008
Is it true that he could die?

483
00:27:41,741 --> 00:27:45,543
I don't think my dad can
handle losing somebody else.

484
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:53,702
We're doing everything we can to
make sure that doesn't happen.

485
00:27:53,839 --> 00:27:55,152
Mm?

486
00:28:04,592 --> 00:28:07,387
- The antitoxin's ready.
- What's next?!

487
00:28:07,412 --> 00:28:09,238
All you people have been doing

488
00:28:09,263 --> 00:28:12,423
is pumping him full of God knows
what, and it isn't helping.

489
00:28:12,448 --> 00:28:13,988
We've been keeping him on antibiotics,

490
00:28:14,013 --> 00:28:15,746
waiting for the right
medication to arrive.

491
00:28:15,771 --> 00:28:18,355
Now that it has, we're able
to target his infection.

492
00:28:19,703 --> 00:28:21,839
You're telling me this one will help?

493
00:28:21,864 --> 00:28:23,912
I'm asking you to trust us.

494
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,750
What are you doing here?
You're not on tonight.

495
00:28:28,775 --> 00:28:30,470
I know how to figure
out who John Doe is.

496
00:28:30,495 --> 00:28:32,993
I figured out the scar on his
elbow was from a UCL replacement.

497
00:28:33,018 --> 00:28:35,222
The surgeon probably used a
tendon from a tissue bank.

498
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:37,690
Anyway, the point is, only a
really skilled baseball player

499
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,142
would ever get a surgery like that.

500
00:28:39,167 --> 00:28:40,939
And, you know, like a
pitcher with prospects.

501
00:28:40,964 --> 00:28:43,562
And we know he speaks French, so
according to the age of the scar

502
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,853
he could've played AAA in some
affiliated minor league...

503
00:28:45,878 --> 00:28:47,864
Mags. Mags. Stop. He's gone.
He's discharged.

504
00:28:47,889 --> 00:28:48,909
He got his memory back?

505
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,770
Yeah. A few hours after
you left this morning.

506
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,060
Wow.

507
00:28:52,085 --> 00:28:54,233
Well. I guess that's good.

508
00:28:54,313 --> 00:28:57,247
I just, uh... was I right? Who is he?

509
00:28:57,272 --> 00:28:59,406
Uh, Brian something?

510
00:28:59,431 --> 00:29:02,611
He remembered his name, he called
his wife, she came to get him.

511
00:29:02,636 --> 00:29:04,032
That's all I know..

512
00:29:04,057 --> 00:29:05,228
Okay.

513
00:29:05,368 --> 00:29:08,193
Well I can stick around, looks like
you might need the help, so...

514
00:29:08,218 --> 00:29:09,681
It's your day off.

515
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:12,961
Go do whatever it is you
do when you're not here.

516
00:29:21,462 --> 00:29:22,778
Do we have to lower the dosage?

517
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:25,067
We'll slow the infusion
and desensitize him.

518
00:29:25,092 --> 00:29:26,903
And if that's not enough?

519
00:29:30,176 --> 00:29:32,559
What's going on? What's
happening to him?

520
00:29:32,584 --> 00:29:34,715
He's having an allergic
reaction to the medication.

521
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,535
It's a side effect, but
one we can manage.

522
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,481
You need to stop. Don't
give him any more.

523
00:29:38,506 --> 00:29:40,184
This is exactly what
I was worried about!

524
00:29:40,209 --> 00:29:42,360
Tristan is in very critical condition.

525
00:29:42,385 --> 00:29:45,130
His throat is closing. He can't
fight this off on his own.

526
00:29:45,155 --> 00:29:47,809
You said that you'd help him. All
you're doing is hurting him!

527
00:29:47,834 --> 00:29:49,090
You're the one who hurt him.

528
00:29:49,115 --> 00:29:50,581
By leaving him vulnerable to this.

529
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:52,356
All I did was try to protect him!

530
00:29:52,381 --> 00:29:53,647
But you didn't!

531
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,356
And if you stand in our way
now, Tristan is going to die,

532
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,115
and it will be your fault.

533
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,214
This place is a madhouse.

534
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,742
I've been on the phone all day.

535
00:30:11,011 --> 00:30:13,063
Want to switch jobs for an hour?

536
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:17,942
I spoke with Tristan's home daycare,

537
00:30:17,967 --> 00:30:20,098
Public Health notified his community.

538
00:30:20,123 --> 00:30:24,049
No one else the kid came into contact
with seems to be symptomatic.

539
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:29,401
I heard you had a few choice
words with the father.

540
00:30:31,573 --> 00:30:33,073
I find that having an outlet

541
00:30:33,098 --> 00:30:36,460
helps keep the frustration
from boiling over.

542
00:30:37,013 --> 00:30:39,755
- What's yours?
- Boxing.

543
00:30:40,921 --> 00:30:43,035
Sometimes bourbon?

544
00:30:48,745 --> 00:30:50,307
You good?

545
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:58,669
If someone with very few resources
needed a place to stay.

546
00:30:58,694 --> 00:31:00,527
Would you have advice for him too?

547
00:31:01,576 --> 00:31:03,112
It's not for me.

548
00:31:04,304 --> 00:31:05,538
Right.

549
00:31:06,014 --> 00:31:08,951
Um... Any other info to go on?

550
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:13,932
The details aren't really mine to share.

551
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:16,066
Does this person have a
history of violence?

552
00:31:16,091 --> 00:31:17,519
Substance abuse?

553
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:20,056
Give it time.

554
00:31:20,081 --> 00:31:21,589
Any place I find on short notice

555
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:23,757
is sure to turn him on to both.

556
00:31:28,291 --> 00:31:29,808
I have to get going.

557
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:32,225
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you.

558
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:37,304
- Hey.
- Labs are back on the Abbott kid.

559
00:31:37,329 --> 00:31:39,254
- Which one.
- The older brother.

560
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:42,527
They screened for diphtheria but
you ordered a broader panel?

561
00:31:49,854 --> 00:31:51,089
Max.

562
00:31:51,283 --> 00:31:53,558
You have antibodies that
your brother doesn't,

563
00:31:53,583 --> 00:31:55,707
but I think you already knew that.

564
00:31:57,008 --> 00:31:58,878
It's a gown for the quarantine room.

565
00:31:58,903 --> 00:32:00,620
If you want to be with
Tristan you can be,

566
00:32:00,645 --> 00:32:03,183
but your father's gonna figure it out.

567
00:32:04,471 --> 00:32:06,168
I know you think he's...

568
00:32:06,193 --> 00:32:08,302
stupid and ignorant.

569
00:32:09,164 --> 00:32:10,463
But he's not.

570
00:32:10,488 --> 00:32:13,766
He's just stubborn, and...

571
00:32:15,149 --> 00:32:17,269
he's lost without my mom.

572
00:32:18,424 --> 00:32:20,324
Tristan needs me, so...

573
00:32:20,349 --> 00:32:23,151
I'm gonna go in there and be with him.

574
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:26,695
What are you talking about?
You are not going in there.

575
00:32:31,642 --> 00:32:33,390
I got vaccinated, Dad.

576
00:32:33,415 --> 00:32:35,323
Like, the day I turned 16.

577
00:32:35,497 --> 00:32:37,073
You and Mom decided for me.

578
00:32:37,098 --> 00:32:39,996
And I didn't agree with your
choice so I made my own.

579
00:32:40,021 --> 00:32:41,831
You hid this from me?

580
00:32:42,241 --> 00:32:43,777
I had to!

581
00:32:47,648 --> 00:32:49,426
You were wrong, Dad.

582
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:54,765
Dr. Hamed? We need you in there, now.

583
00:32:56,056 --> 00:32:58,081
His airway's nearly blocked.

584
00:33:01,623 --> 00:33:03,398
Oh, God.

585
00:33:08,423 --> 00:33:10,444
His neck's too swollen. Bag him.

586
00:33:10,476 --> 00:33:13,229
- He needs a cric.
- Now. We can't wait for an OR.

587
00:33:13,254 --> 00:33:15,247
Tristan needs an operation immediately

588
00:33:15,271 --> 00:33:17,949
that will allow him to breathe
through a hole in his neck.

589
00:33:18,924 --> 00:33:22,245
- Dad.
- Please, save him.

590
00:33:22,270 --> 00:33:25,199
Okay. We'll come and get
you as soon as we're done.

591
00:33:25,931 --> 00:33:29,133
Go ahead. We work as a team, here.

592
00:33:33,798 --> 00:33:36,275
I can't feel any landmarks.
The neck is too swollen.

593
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,184
Make a large vertical incision and
I'll talk you through the anatomy.

594
00:33:45,521 --> 00:33:47,035
Claire.

595
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:49,832
Palpate through the tissue 'til
you feel the cric membrane.

596
00:33:49,857 --> 00:33:52,066
Careful, it'll be small
on a child his age.

597
00:33:56,496 --> 00:33:59,626
- I feel it.
- Make a horizontal stab incision.

598
00:34:04,619 --> 00:34:07,337
- I'm in.
- Sats are 75% and falling.

599
00:34:07,362 --> 00:34:08,775
Keep going, Dr. Hamed.

600
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:11,860
Use your finger to confirm you're
in the trachea, then thread.

601
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,993
- I'm feeling resistance.
- BP's crashing.

602
00:34:15,018 --> 00:34:17,337
- He's going to arrest.
- Stay focused.

603
00:34:17,362 --> 00:34:20,564
It's likely in the subcutaneous
tissues, don't force it.

604
00:34:20,589 --> 00:34:23,788
Use your finger to confirm
you're in the right place.

605
00:34:25,642 --> 00:34:28,985
- Bash. Tell me what you need.
- The bougie isn't threading.

606
00:34:30,637 --> 00:34:33,739
There it goes. Railroad the tube.

607
00:34:49,132 --> 00:34:52,925
Sats are climbing. He's stabilizing.

608
00:34:53,707 --> 00:34:56,607
Well done, everyone.

609
00:34:56,632 --> 00:34:58,724
I'll go tell his father.

610
00:35:13,994 --> 00:35:18,825
We understand that you completed
medical school in 2011.

611
00:35:18,850 --> 00:35:22,364
Then specialized as trauma surgeon
and emergency medicine doctor

612
00:35:22,645 --> 00:35:26,020
practicing at various state
and field hospitals in Syria,

613
00:35:26,045 --> 00:35:28,606
before moving onto a clinic

614
00:35:28,631 --> 00:35:30,747
in a refugee camp in Turkey.

615
00:35:31,417 --> 00:35:33,567
I thought I'd sit in.

616
00:35:33,592 --> 00:35:36,770
Oh, we were just discussing Dr.
Hamed's work history.

617
00:35:36,795 --> 00:35:40,770
Mm. He has more experience
than a few of our attendings.

618
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,463
What happened after Turkey?

619
00:35:44,488 --> 00:35:47,497
- I came here.
- Without your original transcripts.

620
00:35:48,565 --> 00:35:51,379
I have documents proving my identity.

621
00:35:51,404 --> 00:35:53,003
But not your credentials.

622
00:35:53,135 --> 00:35:55,620
Without those, the hospital
assumes a serious risk.

623
00:35:55,645 --> 00:35:57,075
One we can't afford.

624
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,544
How can we be sure
you're truly qualified?

625
00:36:05,259 --> 00:36:06,950
I suppose you can't.

626
00:36:07,076 --> 00:36:08,958
No actually you can.

627
00:36:08,983 --> 00:36:10,200
Because I hired him.

628
00:36:10,225 --> 00:36:12,528
I'm sitting here because of him.

629
00:36:12,946 --> 00:36:15,372
With respect Dr. Bishop,
that's not enough.

630
00:36:15,397 --> 00:36:17,698
I'm not diminishing anything
he did for you but...

631
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:20,395
He just performed an
emergency cricothyrotomy

632
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:23,028
on a kid who has a disease that...

633
00:36:23,299 --> 00:36:25,020
shouldn't even exist here.

634
00:36:25,045 --> 00:36:26,220
Even still.

635
00:36:26,245 --> 00:36:28,201
This is about us needing a paper trail

636
00:36:28,226 --> 00:36:30,334
that proves he is who he says he is.

637
00:36:30,524 --> 00:36:32,290
They targeted doctors.

638
00:36:33,761 --> 00:36:35,271
In Syria.

639
00:36:35,662 --> 00:36:37,772
Especially ones who smuggled vaccines

640
00:36:37,797 --> 00:36:39,654
into the country to try to prevent

641
00:36:39,679 --> 00:36:42,443
typhoid, dysentery, diphtheria.

642
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,469
It's simple.

643
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:50,435
The state controls the universities.
And I am an enemy of the State.

644
00:36:51,581 --> 00:36:54,365
There is no paper trail
because of who I am.

645
00:36:58,312 --> 00:37:00,177
Let's be clear.

646
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,326
What you're saying is that you
can't get your transcripts

647
00:37:03,351 --> 00:37:06,420
because you're an enemy
of the state in Syria.

648
00:37:10,406 --> 00:37:13,147
You know that could expose us
to all kind of scrutiny that...

649
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:14,380
No, no, hold on.

650
00:37:14,405 --> 00:37:17,450
That's not what we're saying.

651
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:21,537
Dr. Hamed and I are going to
pause and think this through.

652
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:27,130
Ty, we'll circle back to you soon. Yeah?

653
00:37:34,296 --> 00:37:37,873
You've opened up a real can of
worms with that confession of you.

654
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,577
Well, it's the truth.

655
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:41,937
Some truths are better left unsaid.

656
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:45,347
Either way, both of us
are out on a limb now.

657
00:37:48,897 --> 00:37:51,197
Tristan's responding well to the cric.

658
00:37:51,222 --> 00:37:53,483
- Great job.
- You too.

659
00:37:53,749 --> 00:37:55,389
You're, uh, you're back tomorrow?

660
00:37:55,414 --> 00:37:57,442
Yeah, then I got two days off.

661
00:37:57,766 --> 00:38:00,779
I'm not on tomorrow, so
I'll take your shift.

662
00:38:00,804 --> 00:38:02,989
Go get an extra day with your family.

663
00:38:03,014 --> 00:38:04,991
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

664
00:38:05,344 --> 00:38:07,952
Thanks, man.

665
00:38:26,656 --> 00:38:28,182
He's stable now.

666
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:30,911
We're going to continue a
modified treatment regimen,

667
00:38:30,936 --> 00:38:32,102
but he's going to recover.

668
00:38:34,087 --> 00:38:36,087
I almost lost him.

669
00:38:38,824 --> 00:38:40,524
But you didn't.

670
00:38:43,054 --> 00:38:44,989
Max is so mad at me.

671
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:48,259
There's still time to fix that.

672
00:38:50,522 --> 00:38:52,456
And Max is a great kid.

673
00:38:52,481 --> 00:38:54,374
So you are doing something right.

674
00:39:02,202 --> 00:39:03,843
Hey.

675
00:39:07,522 --> 00:39:09,489
I never wanted to lie to you.

676
00:39:10,234 --> 00:39:13,144
I'm sorry I made you
feel like you had to.

677
00:39:20,696 --> 00:39:22,986
I love you, son.

678
00:39:42,115 --> 00:39:43,384
Hi!

679
00:39:43,409 --> 00:39:45,675
- I thought it was your day off.
- Yeah!

680
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,344
Mm-hmm, yeah, it is, it is.
It's just, um...

681
00:39:48,369 --> 00:39:52,183
I just, I focus better in here, so...

682
00:39:52,969 --> 00:39:55,394
This might be the strangest
thing I've heard all day.

683
00:39:57,937 --> 00:40:00,053
Bye, Bash.

684
00:40:31,371 --> 00:40:33,640
My building super saw you.

685
00:40:38,014 --> 00:40:39,812
Is he going to tell anyone?

686
00:40:55,285 --> 00:40:58,332
You know, this isn't a
safe place for you anyway.

687
00:40:58,802 --> 00:41:00,201
I know.

688
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,847
It's a shelter you can go to.

689
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:28,194
That's all I can do right now.

690
00:41:31,456 --> 00:41:34,159
Maybe we shouldn't talk for a while.

691
00:41:40,712 --> 00:41:42,792
You're a good friend, Bashir.

692
00:42:02,127 --> 00:42:04,661
You said you've babysat before.

693
00:42:04,686 --> 00:42:06,775
I didn't ask you when.

694
00:42:07,100 --> 00:42:10,498
After Mama and Papa had to send
me to live with the cousins

695
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,704
we went to the camp in Turkey.

696
00:42:12,891 --> 00:42:15,242
There were many kids younger than me.

697
00:42:15,365 --> 00:42:19,454
Warda and I used to take turns
watching them all the time.

698
00:42:19,479 --> 00:42:21,373
You and Warda were close.

699
00:42:21,653 --> 00:42:23,792
You must miss her.

700
00:42:25,364 --> 00:42:30,126
You weren't there, so you wouldn't
have known about the babysitting.

701
00:42:33,925 --> 00:42:36,134
Now I do.

702
00:42:44,105 --> 00:42:46,181
Amira, we're okay.

703
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,694
You'd tell me if we weren't?

704
00:42:51,762 --> 00:42:53,495
I promise.

705
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:05,070
