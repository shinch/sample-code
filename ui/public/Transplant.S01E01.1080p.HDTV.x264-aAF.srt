649
00:38:29,219 --> 00:38:31,353
You are lucky to be alive.

650
00:38:31,991 --> 00:38:33,770
You got a second chance.

651
00:38:34,824 --> 00:38:37,525
You should think about
how you're gonna use it.

652
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:05,868
(JUNE): So, the daughter won't
sign the transplant forms.

653
00:39:05,893 --> 00:39:07,885
Yeah, and I was gonna
come and tell you why.

654
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:09,229
Well, that's good news.

655
00:39:09,254 --> 00:39:10,479
Now you can tell Bishop, too.

656
00:39:10,504 --> 00:39:12,038
- He's up?
- He's awake?

657
00:39:12,063 --> 00:39:13,729
And already ready to grill us.

658
00:39:13,754 --> 00:39:16,063
Good to know he still
feels like himself.

659
00:39:16,088 --> 00:39:18,719
(SLURPING)

660
00:39:27,447 --> 00:39:28,846
Proceed.

661
00:39:28,982 --> 00:39:31,863
Alice DeMarco is a 52-year-old
woman, six months postpartum,

662
00:39:31,888 --> 00:39:34,129
and if it'd occurred to me
sooner that the baby was hers,

663
00:39:34,154 --> 00:39:35,933
well, we would've known the cause, so...

664
00:39:35,958 --> 00:39:37,742
I take full responsibility
for the confusion.

665
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,504
You shouldn't. It's on both of us.

666
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:41,738
She's extubated now, and can
be managed with medication

667
00:39:41,763 --> 00:39:43,930
so there's no need to
jump to a transplant.

668
00:39:45,502 --> 00:39:46,601
(SCOFFS)

669
00:39:46,773 --> 00:39:48,406
Congratulations.

670
00:39:48,484 --> 00:39:50,013
You saved a life.

671
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:53,226
Go save another.

672
00:40:02,186 --> 00:40:03,853
I was gonna take the heat for that.

673
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,443
Yeah, I know. Why would you do that?

674
00:40:05,468 --> 00:40:08,228
Because! Because, because
he likes us at odds.

675
00:40:08,253 --> 00:40:09,865
He thinks it makes us sharper.

676
00:40:09,890 --> 00:40:11,884
Well, maybe he's right.
We did get the answer.

677
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:15,289
- (CHUCKLING)
- Well technically, I got the answer.

678
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:17,025
That's the spirit.

679
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:21,920
(BABY CRYING, SOFT MUSIC)

680
00:40:46,562 --> 00:40:47,928
Mr. Hamed.

681
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,956
What's going to happen to me?

682
00:40:53,981 --> 00:40:56,166
We identified the truck driver.

683
00:40:56,687 --> 00:40:58,320
His brakes failed.

684
00:40:58,345 --> 00:40:59,845
He jumped,

685
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:02,211
and got crushed under the wheels.

686
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,424
It was an accident.

687
00:41:07,097 --> 00:41:08,697
You're free to go.

688
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:10,886
Your ID.

689
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:18,227
Before you leave,

690
00:41:18,252 --> 00:41:20,770
one more doctor needs to see you.

691
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:40,825
(KNOCKING)

692
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,169
They said you wanted to see me?

693
00:41:51,021 --> 00:41:52,891
My name is Jed Bishop.

694
00:41:53,610 --> 00:41:55,889
Thank you for saving my life.

695
00:41:56,334 --> 00:41:57,849
You're welcome.

696
00:41:58,603 --> 00:42:00,269
Take a seat.

697
00:42:04,677 --> 00:42:06,400
Long night?

698
00:42:07,562 --> 00:42:10,502
- Did we fix you up, at least?
- Mm-hmm.

699
00:42:12,306 --> 00:42:14,039
The kid with you, uh...

700
00:42:14,255 --> 00:42:15,533
Your daughter?

701
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:17,078
My sister.

702
00:42:19,069 --> 00:42:21,748
We have met before, of course.

703
00:42:22,022 --> 00:42:25,151
When I interviewed you for a
job, but then didn't hire you.

704
00:42:26,909 --> 00:42:28,256
But...

705
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:31,563
I think we need to do it again.

706
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,761
So...

707
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:36,681
Tell me a little about yourself.

708
00:42:38,361 --> 00:42:43,759
