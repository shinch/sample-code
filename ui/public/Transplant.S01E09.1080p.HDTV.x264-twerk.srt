if she can be discharged safely.

be an isolated incident.

schizophrenia more likely, right?

- I had a patient with similar symptoms.

Periodic meaning
it's not permanent?

870
00:38:47,386 --> 00:38:49,587
The disease itself is permanent,

871
00:38:49,612 --> 00:38:51,579
but the paralysis is not.

872
00:38:52,071 --> 00:38:53,705
What do we do for him?

873
00:38:53,730 --> 00:38:56,665
You manage it,
with diet and medication.

874
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:59,345
So he's not gonna lose
the use of his legs?

875
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:00,970
No. (SIGHS)

876
00:39:00,995 --> 00:39:03,512
The muscle weakness will come and go,

877
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:06,283
but Trey should be able
to live very normally.

878
00:39:06,753 --> 00:39:08,431
But he'll be able to train again?

879
00:39:08,456 --> 00:39:10,915
I would recommend laying off
a few weeks,

880
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,853
but that'll have to be up to Trey.

881
00:39:13,878 --> 00:39:15,537
Don't worry, honey,

882
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:18,564
we're gonna get you the
best physio we can.

883
00:39:19,352 --> 00:39:21,150
What if I don't want that?

884
00:39:21,175 --> 00:39:24,209
Buddy, it's gonna be okay. I know
you're a little freaked out, b...

885
00:39:24,234 --> 00:39:26,173
No, Dad, like... It's not that.

886
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,023
I don't wanna dive anymore.

887
00:39:29,554 --> 00:39:32,790
And if that means that you two
have to get a divorce, then...

888
00:39:32,815 --> 00:39:34,615
it just has to happen.

889
00:39:35,852 --> 00:39:38,077
You think
that we're gonna split up?

890
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,624
Aren't you?

891
00:39:40,649 --> 00:39:43,374
I mean, you two basically
hate each other.

892
00:39:43,399 --> 00:39:46,285
And the only thing you have
in common is my diving.

893
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:49,280
Trey, your father and I, we...

894
00:39:49,305 --> 00:39:51,616
We never meant to make you
feel that way.

895
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,773
Well, you did.

(MOTHER): We're so sorry.
That wasn't fair of us.

898
00:39:59,132 --> 00:40:02,143
(FATHER): And you should
only dive if you want to.

899
00:40:08,366 --> 00:40:11,112
I thought you were gonna go
for three days straight.

900
00:40:11,385 --> 00:40:13,920
I figured it's about time
I get some rest.

901
00:40:14,041 --> 00:40:16,057
That doesn't sound like you.

902
00:40:21,429 --> 00:40:22,979
Bash?

903
00:40:23,152 --> 00:40:24,620
Does it...

904
00:40:25,300 --> 00:40:27,800
Does this place feel
like home to you yet?

905
00:40:29,572 --> 00:40:31,081
Mmm...

906
00:40:34,275 --> 00:40:36,878
Yeah. It's starting to.

(SOFT INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC)

908
00:41:00,888 --> 00:41:02,189
Ready?

909
00:41:02,214 --> 00:41:04,082
Good to go. How was your day?

910
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:05,769
Long and dull.

911
00:41:06,267 --> 00:41:09,178
But I guess that's a good thing.
How about you?

912
00:41:10,091 --> 00:41:12,474
- Same.
- Yeah?

913
00:41:14,714 --> 00:41:18,304
I mean, there was one interesting
thing that happened.

914
00:41:18,543 --> 00:41:20,022
Hmm?

915
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,553
I, uh...

916
00:41:22,972 --> 00:41:26,320
I got invited to the arcade
with my boyfriend and his son.

917
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:29,782
So, you know, there's that.

919
00:41:31,686 --> 00:41:33,112
Uh, Dr. Bishop?

920
00:41:33,137 --> 00:41:34,143
Mm-hmm?

921
00:41:34,168 --> 00:41:37,042
That permanent pediatrics
opening you told me about,

922
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,621
is that still on the table?

923
00:41:38,973 --> 00:41:42,109
I got the impression you
didn't want it. What's changed?

924
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,796
I did.

925
00:41:43,821 --> 00:41:45,757
Turns out I do want it.

926
00:41:45,782 --> 00:41:47,282
If it's not too late,

927
00:41:47,307 --> 00:41:49,581
I'd like to take you up on your
offer of a recommendation.

928

Applications are due
at the end of next week.

929
00:41:52,724 --> 00:41:54,556
Thank you, sir.

930
00:41:57,469 --> 00:41:59,645
You took a risk for Bash today.

931
00:41:59,686 --> 00:42:02,972
- Cops give you any trouble?
- What? I can handle a little trouble.

932
00:42:03,311 --> 00:42:04,948
You've got plans tonight?

933
00:42:04,973 --> 00:42:07,820
Well, there's a glass of wine
with my name on it at home.

Did I tell you about my championship
game when I was 18?

- A header to win...
- In extra time.

942
00:42:39,629 --> 00:42:42,064
You mentioned it once or twice.

have to hear that story again.
