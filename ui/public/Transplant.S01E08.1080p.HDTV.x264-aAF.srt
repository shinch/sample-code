00:08:20,189 --> 00:08:21,752
Take a breath.

176
00:08:22,496 --> 00:08:24,047
Sit up.

177
00:08:25,611 --> 00:08:27,078
It's getting worse?

178
00:08:27,103 --> 00:08:29,882
I'm used to getting up
with a wet pillow.

179
00:08:29,907 --> 00:08:32,835
The last few days it's been
more like a pond than a puddle.

180
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,139
Mm.

181
00:08:35,025 --> 00:08:38,132
Okay, and you've spoken to
your family doctor about this?

182
00:08:38,157 --> 00:08:39,898
She says I have bad allergies,

183
00:08:39,923 --> 00:08:43,132
and sent me to an ear, nose and throat
doctor who said the same thing.

184
00:08:43,164 --> 00:08:44,953
They put me on this medication.

185
00:08:44,978 --> 00:08:46,083
Diphenhydramine.

186
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,805
It makes me drowsy.

187
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:50,875
What's the point in feeling that
way if it's not even helping?

188
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,450
Well, I'm gonna have a look, okay?

189
00:08:54,394 --> 00:08:56,329
Can you open your mouth?

190
00:09:00,101 --> 00:09:02,188
Is your family from the Caribbean?

191
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,018
Jamaica, but my parents met here.

192
00:09:04,119 --> 00:09:05,619
I was born in Trinidad.

193
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,254
My husband, too.

194
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:11,552
Your parents must be so proud of you.

195
00:09:11,764 --> 00:09:13,887
Beautiful black woman.

196
00:09:13,912 --> 00:09:15,430
Big city doctor.

197
00:09:16,214 --> 00:09:17,715
No pain?

198
00:09:18,213 --> 00:09:19,647
Anyway...

199
00:09:19,672 --> 00:09:23,406
I'm sure you tell them the same
thing our daughter tells us.

200
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,015
Be proud, be supportive,

201
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,152
but do it from the sidelines.

202
00:09:29,381 --> 00:09:32,239
How long have you had
that bump on your collarbone?

203
00:09:32,517 --> 00:09:34,752
Is it something
I should be concerned about?

204
00:09:34,822 --> 00:09:36,601
Not necessarily, but I'll...

205
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:38,078
I'll have a closer look.

206
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:41,945
Can I get a CT and labs
on Mrs. Willis?

207
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:43,930
Mrs. Willis, that's the
elderly lady with the flu?

208
00:09:43,955 --> 00:09:45,364
Yeah, she's having dizzy spells.

209
00:09:45,389 --> 00:09:47,106
We need to call her GP for a history.

210
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:49,199
I won't let it slow me down.

211
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,677
How's doctor Hunter today?

212
00:09:51,702 --> 00:09:53,500
He's had better mornings.

213
00:09:54,223 --> 00:09:55,505
Doctor Hamed?

214
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:56,805
Hey, is everything okay?

215
00:09:56,981 --> 00:09:58,662
OB is very busy today.

216
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,610
They said they could see
us, but not for a while.

217
00:10:00,635 --> 00:10:01,938
Maria's very tired,

218
00:10:01,963 --> 00:10:03,367
I just want her to be seen.

219
00:10:03,392 --> 00:10:05,710
We were wondering if you could
check her and the baby out?

220
00:10:05,735 --> 00:10:07,135
No problem. Follow me.

221
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,796
Blood pressure's normal.

222
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,583
You must be getting excited.

224
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,656
- How many weeks?
- Thirty-one.

225
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,015
And tell me about your symptoms.

226
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,896
We spent the weekend
at a friend's cottage up north.

227
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:21,679
I started to feel nauseous
on the car ride back.

228
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,304
- And this was yesterday?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:10:23,329 --> 00:10:26,758
I thought it was car sickness,
but this morning I had a fever.

230
00:10:26,783 --> 00:10:29,828
And then we started to worry that
the baby wasn't moving as much,

231
00:10:29,853 --> 00:10:32,570
but um, we couldn't be sure, so...

232
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:34,212
Let's take a look.

233
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:36,617
Sorry, I know it's a little cold.

Yes. Very good.

237
00:10:45,117 --> 00:10:46,773

Because I think I can tell.
No spoilers!

just waited this long,

240

and we want to go the distance.

241
00:10:54,252 --> 00:10:55,862

245
00:11:02,136 --> 00:11:04,791
But there is one more
thing I should look at.

246
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:08,766
Um, how long have you had
that rash on your arm?

247
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:12,829
I scraped myself on the dock
at the cottage,

248
00:11:12,854 --> 00:11:15,468
climbing down to the
water to go for a swim.

249
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,555
- Any pain?
- A bit.

250
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:21,228
But I bruise easily.

251
00:11:21,498 --> 00:11:23,141
That's all it is, right?

252
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,555
Uh, we just need to make sure.

253

prep the Lidocaine.

Are, are you worried
about something?

255
00:11:31,971 --> 00:11:34,915
If there's an infection, we just
need to know how to manage it.

256
00:11:35,531 --> 00:11:37,231
It's okay.

- Do you feel anything?
- No.

259

- You may want to look away.

the same thing.

I'm a waiting on rush labs.

I have a 31 weeks pregnant woman

270
00:12:27,317 --> 00:12:29,089
who seems to have a
very serious infection.

271
00:12:29,114 --> 00:12:30,792
31 weeks? Why is she not in OB?

272
00:12:30,817 --> 00:12:33,198
They were swamped, so the
couple came to me directly.

273

You know, I'd offer to
help, but I'm just...

- Dr. Bishop?
- Yeah, what is it?

279
00:12:52,502 --> 00:12:54,926
I've got a 36-year-old woman,
31 weeks pregnant

280

flesh-eating bacteria.

(OMINOUS MUSIC)

282
00:13:02,157 --> 00:13:05,244
I have never seen necrotizing
fasciitis in a pregnant woman.

283
00:13:05,269 --> 00:13:07,634
Neither have I. Have you
treated this infection before?

284
00:13:07,659 --> 00:13:10,166
No sir, but I have seen
numerous cases of gangrene.

285
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,800
Then you know
we have to move fast.

286
00:13:11,825 --> 00:13:13,585
You've started her on antibiotics?

287
00:13:13,610 --> 00:13:16,490
600 milligrams of IV Clinda
and 2 grams of IV Ancef.

288
00:13:16,515 --> 00:13:18,611
She's already on fluids.
How'd she contract it?

289
00:13:18,636 --> 00:13:20,175
She scraped herself on a dock.

290
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,424
- And the baby?
- Fetal heart rate's normal.

291
00:13:22,449 --> 00:13:26,050
Sepsis from infection can cause
stillbirth or miscarriage.

292
00:13:26,075 --> 00:13:28,580
Well, it's presenting on her upper
arm, just above the elbow,

293
00:13:28,605 --> 00:13:31,140
so hopefully we can control
it and limit spread.

294
00:13:31,165 --> 00:13:33,236
We'll do an MRI,
see if that's the case.

295
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:34,563
And then what, Dr. Hamed?

296
00:13:34,588 --> 00:13:37,022
Assuming it hasn't spread,
what are her options?

297
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:38,881
Uh, radical debridement.

298
00:13:38,906 --> 00:13:40,683
But that means putting her under.

299
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,997
Extremely risky for a pregnant woman.

300
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,816
The only other option
is amputation,

301
00:13:44,841 --> 00:13:47,077
and she'll need a general
anaesthetic either way.

302
00:13:47,102 --> 00:13:49,558
Well, the decision has to be
the patient's ultimately.

303
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:51,519

(MARIA LAUGHING)

310
00:14:08,002 --> 00:14:10,855
And this other option,
debridement?

311
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,667
- It means I get to keep it?
- Yes.

312
00:14:12,692 --> 00:14:13,785
But you have to understand,

313
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:16,480
amputation increases the
likelihood that we get everything.

314
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,964
Debridment means cutting out
only the infected tissue,

315
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:21,487
but the risk of the bacteria
spreading are higher.

316
00:14:22,392 --> 00:14:24,526

gone for that swim.

- No, Javier, you can't.

and aggressive.

Am I not already exposed?

320

Let's hope not.
And we cannot take that chance.

doing well is you doing well.

There. Yeah. Turns out
cerebrospinal fluid

343
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,077
has been leaking from her
brain into her sinuses.

She's seen her GP multiple
times about this,

345

even an ENT who thought it was mucus.
But it's not.

malformation of the dura?

Nope. I found a small
deformity on her collarbone.

00:15:47,227 --> 00:15:49,295
It's not the cause of the
leak, but it is a clue.

350
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,749
So turns out three years
ago, she had a minor fall.

351
00:15:51,774 --> 00:15:54,632
Yeah. She was at the park with her
grandson, fractures her clavicle.

352
00:15:54,657 --> 00:15:56,324
The bone didn't heal properly.

353
00:15:56,349 --> 00:15:58,639
Not uncommon in a patient
over 50. But...

354
00:15:58,694 --> 00:16:01,417
There was a small basal skull fracture
that they missed at the time,

355
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:02,886
resulting in a dural defect.

356
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:04,983
It's been asymptomatic until now.

357
00:16:05,365 --> 00:16:07,065
If you hadn't caught this,

358
00:16:07,090 --> 00:16:11,780
she would have had severe
seizures, or even meningitis.

384
00:17:23,414 --> 00:17:25,656
she wasn't herself, then
started throwing up.

You're worried you
might've missed a seizure?

Maybe while she was asleep.

396
00:17:51,190 --> 00:17:52,777
She doesn't wear the helmet at night

397
00:17:52,802 --> 00:17:55,552

would explain the nausea.

I keep a detailed journal
of all her seizures,

and she's never had one
in her sleep before.

400
00:18:00,425 --> 00:18:02,386
Couldn't the vomiting
be related to the flu?

401
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:05,713
It's possible,
but she isn't running a fever.

your head last night?

She came in with flu.

That doesn't require a CAT scan.

435

Her GP has her on an SSRI instead
of treating the nerve pain.

436
00:19:21,056 --> 00:19:22,617
Well, maybe there's a very
good reason for that.

437
00:19:22,642 --> 00:19:24,289
Maybe they tried antiseizure drugs

438
00:19:24,314 --> 00:19:25,977

and they didn't work

Is that part of her epilepsy?

594
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:25,312
It is a common side effect,

There's infected tissue

Which means amputation
is no longer an option.

Sir, the baby might not
withstand a second debridement.

And if the infection spreads
to the uterus and fetus,

are very real possibilities.

- Yes. Viable.

Maybe not for the mother.

Delaying debridement for a
caesarean poses a major risk.

trigger multiple organ failure.
