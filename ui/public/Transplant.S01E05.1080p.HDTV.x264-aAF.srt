1
00:00:00,461 --> 00:00:03,584
When I was your age, I had to spend
the night in a hospital too.

2
00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:05,126
Lots of times, actually.

3
00:00:05,151 --> 00:00:09,311
<i>It's difficult when you come
home for such a short time.</i>

4
00:00:09,379 --> 00:00:11,413
I know it's hard. But we're here now.

5
00:00:11,438 --> 00:00:13,359
You should make the most of it.

6
00:00:43,057 --> 00:00:44,657
I can't accept this.

7
00:00:44,682 --> 00:00:46,816
It's a gift for Eid, tradition.

8
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:49,237
Okay? How's the place?

9
00:00:49,314 --> 00:00:50,666
It's fine.

10
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:53,565
I don't have much
privacy, but it's a bed.

11
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:56,370
You haven't heard from
the police again I hope?

12
00:00:56,395 --> 00:00:58,643
No. You?

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,978
Nothing.

14
00:01:01,362 --> 00:01:03,315
Hopefully they've forgotten me now.

15
00:01:04,143 --> 00:01:07,610
And what about work? Have
you been able to find any?

16
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:15,991
I did. I did.

17
00:01:19,686 --> 00:01:20,919
English, Amira.

18
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:23,701
If he needs money,

19
00:01:23,726 --> 00:01:25,756
maybe he needs food?

20
00:01:26,475 --> 00:01:28,233
Amira, you know I'm working, huh?

21
00:01:28,683 --> 00:01:30,717
What's the story they told?

22
00:01:30,742 --> 00:01:34,137
So many people came for Mama's Maqlubeh

23
00:01:34,406 --> 00:01:38,266
that we finished it all?
Baba had to bring more lamb?

24
00:01:38,625 --> 00:01:41,228
You remember that? You were so young.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,952
We should be celebrating.

26
00:01:42,977 --> 00:01:45,779
What? We went to prayers.
I got you new clothes.

27
00:01:46,422 --> 00:01:48,568
I wish they were still here.

28
00:01:50,263 --> 00:01:51,821
I know.

29
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:06,256
I want to come to the hospital with you.

30
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,257
- Amira.
- It's Saturday.

31
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:10,965
I will be quiet. I won't move.
I'll do my homework.

32
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,508
I have a lot of homework, Bash.

33
00:02:12,533 --> 00:02:15,471
Amira, it's not the kind of place
people go for no reason, okay?

34
00:02:15,496 --> 00:02:18,848
I have a reason. I want
to be with you today.

35
00:02:21,049 --> 00:02:22,405
Okay.

36
00:02:34,746 --> 00:02:36,254
Hello, Dr. Leblanc.

37
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:38,746
Force of habit. I'm sorry.

38
00:02:45,787 --> 00:02:48,503
I know I've missed a few appointments.
I know.

39
00:02:49,727 --> 00:02:51,792
All you're supposed to do
is see me twice a year.

40
00:02:51,817 --> 00:02:53,175
Yeah, I know.

41
00:02:54,538 --> 00:02:56,004
You're avoiding me, Magalie.

42
00:02:56,029 --> 00:02:58,346
No, I'm... I'm busy.

43
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,815
Your rhythm's normal now,

44
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:05,508
but there was a flag on
your remote monitoring.

45
00:03:05,544 --> 00:03:07,184
- Arrhythmia?
- Mm.

46
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:10,020
- More than one flag?
- Three. You didn't feel them?

47
00:03:10,045 --> 00:03:11,621
We replace a pacemaker every six years.

48
00:03:11,646 --> 00:03:13,076
I've had this one almost that long.

49
00:03:13,101 --> 00:03:14,408
It's probably just a glitch.

50
00:03:14,433 --> 00:03:17,201
Humour me. How've you been feeling?

51
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:19,754
Totally at odds with whatever
report that thing sent you.

52
00:03:19,779 --> 00:03:21,168
I'm fine. If there was anything wrong,

53
00:03:21,193 --> 00:03:22,911
I'd be feeling dizziness,
shortness of breath, chest pain.

54
00:03:22,936 --> 00:03:24,731
Yeah, yeah, you're a doctor, I get it.

55
00:03:24,910 --> 00:03:27,066
I'd still like to do a
stress test to be sure.

56
00:03:28,570 --> 00:03:30,182
Half an hour. That's all I need.

57
00:03:30,207 --> 00:03:31,614
I've got to go to work. Next week?

58
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,098
What do I have to do here, Mags?

59
00:03:33,123 --> 00:03:34,845
Get Bishop to make you
my cardiology fellow?

60
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,514
I'll be back, I promise.

61
00:03:43,527 --> 00:03:45,442
Do you ever not start early?

62
00:03:45,467 --> 00:03:48,161
Oh! Ah! You need to tell me if you see

63
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,903
the girl with snakes in her veins.

64
00:03:49,928 --> 00:03:51,903
Hey Charlie. Did you come
for a needle exchange?

65
00:03:51,928 --> 00:03:54,285
He was polling all of triage,
asking about snakes.

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:56,848
Scared a couple people so they
said to put him in Exam 4.

67
00:03:56,873 --> 00:03:58,621
Okay. I'll get a nurse to start fluids.

68
00:03:58,646 --> 00:04:00,347
He seems a bit off his baseline.

69
00:04:00,372 --> 00:04:02,243
Good morning, Dr. Curtis.

70
00:04:10,512 --> 00:04:14,559
Lou? Are you two a thing?
Like a secret work thing?

71
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,964
Please learn boundaries.

72
00:04:16,989 --> 00:04:19,830
Fast start today, we
have a GSW coming in,

73
00:04:19,855 --> 00:04:22,862
33-year-old male, ETA 8 minutes.

74
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:24,533
I need blood. I need bodies.

75
00:04:24,558 --> 00:04:26,393
There's a found down on the way in too.

76
00:04:26,418 --> 00:04:30,588
Dr. Hamed takes the found down. Dr.
Curtis, Dr. Leblanc with the GSW.

77
00:04:30,613 --> 00:04:31,862
Any info on the patient?

78
00:04:31,887 --> 00:04:34,081
Elderly woman in cardiac arrest.
That's all I've got.

79
00:04:34,106 --> 00:04:37,742
Oh and good news. I'll
be your attending today.

80
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,979
What? It was a scheduling mess up.

81
00:04:42,019 --> 00:04:44,160
Meaning you went in and messed it up?

82
00:04:46,897 --> 00:04:49,071
Lena Joseph, 85 years old,

83
00:04:49,096 --> 00:04:51,385
VF arrest. Mailman saw her
in the living room floor and

84
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,659
broke through the front window.

85
00:04:52,684 --> 00:04:55,651
She's obviously been down for
some time, she looks dehydrated.

86
00:04:55,689 --> 00:04:59,440
12 minutes CPR. Defib'd
twice and two doses of epi.

87
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,600
No pulse. She's still in VFIB.

88
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,730
Okay, charging the defibrillator, 200J,

89
00:05:04,755 --> 00:05:07,206
unsynchronized. Everybody clear.

90
00:05:07,231 --> 00:05:09,226
<i>Shock advised.</i>

91
00:05:09,283 --> 00:05:11,284
Start compressions right away.

92
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,070
Do we know how long she was lying
here before anybody found her?

93
00:05:14,095 --> 00:05:16,227
Could've been days. The
mailman said she lives alone.

94
00:05:16,252 --> 00:05:18,049
There's a daughter, but
she wasn't around.

95
00:05:18,225 --> 00:05:20,378
Two minutes of CPR and
then a pulse check.

96
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:24,024
Will Marsh, BP 80 over
60, heart rate 110.

97
00:05:24,049 --> 00:05:26,017
They were held up at
gunpoint outside a bank.

98
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,245
Will pushed me out of the way.

99
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,955
I was handing over my purse
and the guy shot anyway!

100
00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:33,042
Okay, stay here, alright?
Stay right here.

101
00:05:35,635 --> 00:05:38,221
One, two, three.

102
00:05:38,246 --> 00:05:40,174
Will, can you feel your arms and legs?

103
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,471
What do we have?

104
00:05:41,871 --> 00:05:44,659
Single penetrating bullet
wound to the abdomen.

105
00:05:44,684 --> 00:05:46,752
Husband and wife report
hearing one shot fired.

106
00:05:46,777 --> 00:05:48,344
Has he been persistently hypotensive?

107
00:05:48,585 --> 00:05:51,667
80's four over 62.

108
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:53,619
Let's log roll him to
check for other wounds.

109
00:05:53,792 --> 00:05:56,861
On three. One, two, three.

110
00:05:56,886 --> 00:05:58,900
Stop! Please

111
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,260
Will, let me know where it hurts!

112
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,073
- No exit wound.
- One, two, three.

113
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:10,589
The bullet is still inside, sir.

114
00:06:10,614 --> 00:06:12,861
What does the bullet rule say, Dr.
Leblanc?

115
00:06:13,229 --> 00:06:16,257
The bullet wound seen on imaging
should always be an even number.

116
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:20,283
LOC decreasing. Get him
some blood and TXA.

117
00:06:24,244 --> 00:06:26,626
- FAST positive.
- Let's get an AP,

118
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,159
abdomen and chest,

119
00:06:28,184 --> 00:06:30,620
see if we can find the
bullet or fragments.

120
00:06:31,213 --> 00:06:34,115
Let's roll him, on three.
One, two, three.

121
00:06:35,396 --> 00:06:37,816
One, two, three.

122
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,502
Give me a sec.

123
00:06:39,893 --> 00:06:40,993
Will?

124
00:06:41,018 --> 00:06:42,890
Ma'am, you can't be in here right now.

125
00:06:42,915 --> 00:06:44,791
Lucy, Will's a fighter! Okay?

126
00:06:44,816 --> 00:06:46,033
We need to figure out the path

127
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:47,604
the bullet took when it
went through his body

128
00:06:47,629 --> 00:06:50,237
Dr. Bishop? Looks like the bullet
is lodged against his pancreas.

129
00:06:50,262 --> 00:06:52,997
The best thing you can do for
Will is to give us space to work.

130
00:06:53,022 --> 00:06:54,682
I'll come and explain everything after.

131
00:06:54,707 --> 00:06:56,893
Find out how long OR needs
for an emergency lap.

132
00:06:56,918 --> 00:06:58,182
On it.

133
00:06:59,233 --> 00:07:01,042
While you're filling the wife in,

134
00:07:01,067 --> 00:07:03,409
- get a full medical history.
- Copy.

135
00:07:04,107 --> 00:07:06,125
Recharging defib.

136
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:08,331
Stop compressions. Everybody clear.

137
00:07:08,382 --> 00:07:10,432
<i>Shock advised.</i>

138
00:07:13,829 --> 00:07:15,812
Okay, I've got a pulse.

139
00:07:17,243 --> 00:07:18,815
She's waking up!

140
00:07:20,143 --> 00:07:21,818
Mrs. Joseph?

141
00:07:24,034 --> 00:07:26,035
It's good to have you back with us.

142
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,682
This isn't right.

143
00:07:27,707 --> 00:07:30,924
It's okay. You were
under cardiac arrest,

144
00:07:30,949 --> 00:07:32,703
but we were able to revive you.

145
00:07:33,808 --> 00:07:37,208
You were supposed to let me die.

146
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:59,603
- Synced and corrected by martythecrazy -
- www.addic7ed.com -

147
00:08:00,965 --> 00:08:02,691
- Well, that's a new one.

148
00:08:03,223 --> 00:08:06,143
Charlie's in the vents? Going where?

149
00:08:07,324 --> 00:08:08,958
Pharmacy, maybe.

150
00:08:09,252 --> 00:08:11,823
He's out of luck, all the
narcotics are locked up.

151
00:08:13,597 --> 00:08:15,947
Should I call the cops, Dr. Bishop?

152
00:08:16,112 --> 00:08:17,456
Or the fire department?

153
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:19,751
Not much point until we can find him.

154
00:08:19,776 --> 00:08:22,401
We've known Charlie for years.
He's harmless.

155
00:08:22,426 --> 00:08:24,018
Best to try and coax him down

156
00:08:24,043 --> 00:08:26,541
before we have to take
more drastic action.

157
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:29,041
I connected with Lena
Joseph's daughter, Erin.

158
00:08:29,066 --> 00:08:30,122
She's on her way.

159
00:08:30,147 --> 00:08:31,448
How did she react?

160
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,713
Like she found out her
mother almost died.

161
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,409
Not sure there's a standard response.

162
00:08:35,434 --> 00:08:37,401
I don't know how you'd be
able to forgive yourself

163
00:08:37,426 --> 00:08:39,044
for something like that.

164
00:08:40,718 --> 00:08:42,553
We don't know the whole story.

165
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:46,027
Well, we know she wasn't there,
and her mother was alone.

166
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:51,526
I've learned to not let what
happens here affect me personally.

167
00:08:53,349 --> 00:08:56,078
Or maybe it's what makes
you a good doctor.

168
00:09:01,272 --> 00:09:03,440
Miles, this is Doctor Hunter.

169
00:09:03,465 --> 00:09:05,222
You can call me Theo.

170
00:09:05,247 --> 00:09:06,995
What seems to be the problem, pal?

171
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:08,831
Persistent erection.

172
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,843
That can happen.

173
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:13,012
You here by yourself?

174
00:09:13,988 --> 00:09:16,213
He didn't wanna give
us his mom's number.

175
00:09:16,599 --> 00:09:17,933
Okay.

176
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:19,936
How long it's been going on?

177
00:09:21,738 --> 00:09:24,439
Could you give us a minute? Thank you.

178
00:09:28,688 --> 00:09:30,472
Four hours.

179
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:32,956
It hurts.

180
00:09:32,981 --> 00:09:35,159
Okay, Miles, you're going
to be fine, but...

181
00:09:35,184 --> 00:09:38,268
four hours is a long time. You
wanna tell me what's going on?

182
00:09:38,293 --> 00:09:40,761
I was supposed to meet
this girl after school.

183
00:09:40,786 --> 00:09:42,791
So you took something.

184
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:44,909
I found some of my dad's old pills.

185
00:09:44,934 --> 00:09:46,971
And that's why you didn't
want us to call your mom.

186
00:09:46,996 --> 00:09:49,831
She'd freak! We don't talk
about this kind of stuff.

187
00:09:49,856 --> 00:09:52,011
It might resolve with ice
and pseudoephedrine.

188
00:09:52,354 --> 00:09:54,845
If plan A works, we don't
have to call your mom.

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,037
What's plan B?

190
00:09:56,062 --> 00:09:58,433
Let's cross that bridge
if we come to it. Okay?

191
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,285
Are you my mother's doctor?

192
00:10:04,318 --> 00:10:06,889
- Yes. Bashir Hamed.
- Hi.

193
00:10:09,686 --> 00:10:11,737
They said that you were out of town?

194
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:14,550
At a month-long training
program for work.

195
00:10:14,672 --> 00:10:18,359
But I drove straight back
here as soon as they called.

196
00:10:19,130 --> 00:10:21,080
I saw her just before I left.

197
00:10:23,573 --> 00:10:25,928
How could I have missed
her being so ill?

198
00:10:25,953 --> 00:10:28,722
She was extremely dehydrated
when she was brought in.

199
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:30,159
Malnourished.

200
00:10:30,435 --> 00:10:33,112
She hadn't had any food
or water for days.

201
00:10:33,287 --> 00:10:35,222
I stocked her fridge.

202
00:10:35,388 --> 00:10:37,808
I even tried to set her
up with a meal program.

203
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,306
Has she been...

204
00:10:39,604 --> 00:10:41,808
forgetful? Or...

205
00:10:42,027 --> 00:10:44,395
I don't think so. Why?

206
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:48,065
It's possible that she stopped
eating and drinking...

207
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,608
on purpose.

208
00:10:49,755 --> 00:10:53,278
No. My mother would never do that.

209
00:10:59,098 --> 00:11:01,032
- Lucy?
- Hmm?

210
00:11:01,342 --> 00:11:05,058
Will's being prepped for an emergency
surgery to remove the bullet.

211
00:11:05,306 --> 00:11:08,183
But you said it's been
lodged in his abdomen?

212
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:10,394
Yes. Which caused significant bleeding.

213
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,800
Surgeons will be able to
tell us if there's damage

214
00:11:12,825 --> 00:11:15,174
to his organs once they take it out.

215
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:18,388
Do you want to sit down? Please.

216
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,260
Um...

217
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:26,050
The guy, he smelled like cigarettes.

218
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:29,439
And at first, I thought he was
just waiting to use the machine.

219
00:11:29,896 --> 00:11:32,164
I just wanted to stop for cash.

220
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,906
And if I didn't, none of
this would be happening.

221
00:11:37,908 --> 00:11:40,450
Police told us they
arrested the shooter.

222
00:11:40,722 --> 00:11:43,371
Now he asked if I was doing okay.

223
00:11:43,837 --> 00:11:45,838
He's lying there...

224
00:11:46,584 --> 00:11:48,167
Bleeding...

225
00:11:49,377 --> 00:11:51,671
and he's asking if I'm okay?

226
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,256
You found yourself a good one.

227
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,301
I don't deserve him.

228
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:58,984
I'm sure that's not true.

229
00:12:00,729 --> 00:12:02,515
But Will needs you now.

230
00:12:03,994 --> 00:12:07,517
I'd like to ask you a few questions
about his medical history.

231
00:12:07,542 --> 00:12:09,147
It'll help us treat him.

232
00:12:10,594 --> 00:12:12,534
Let's start with medication.

233
00:12:12,559 --> 00:12:15,652
Is he taking anything regularly?

234
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,790
Mom? Your doctor thinks

235
00:12:19,815 --> 00:12:22,325
that you may have stopped
eating on purpose?

236
00:12:23,887 --> 00:12:25,844
I told him there's no
way that could be true.

237
00:12:25,869 --> 00:12:29,583
But are you not feeling well?
Have you lost your appetite?

238
00:12:29,813 --> 00:12:32,920
I didn't want you to
have to deal with this.

239
00:12:37,657 --> 00:12:39,968
Are you saying he's right?

240
00:12:42,212 --> 00:12:44,807
I'm so sorry, honey.

241
00:12:46,652 --> 00:12:51,106
The cleaner was coming Monday.
He was going to find me.

242
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:54,149
- You tried to die?
- More like...

243
00:12:54,871 --> 00:12:57,320
I stopped trying to live.

244
00:12:57,972 --> 00:13:01,199
Food. Water.

245
00:13:01,344 --> 00:13:02,783
My pills.

246
00:13:03,355 --> 00:13:05,661
I had it all planned out

247
00:13:06,054 --> 00:13:07,872
I don't understand Why.

248
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:09,691
Why would you do this?

249
00:13:09,716 --> 00:13:11,834
I'm old, Erin.

250
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:14,045
Everything hurts.

251
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:17,298
I wanted to control this.

252
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:19,988
Go on my terms.

253
00:13:20,178 --> 00:13:21,779
While I still could.

254
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:25,556
How could you be thinking
like this and not tell me?

255
00:13:25,767 --> 00:13:27,808
Please, honey.

256
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:30,143
Try to understand.

257
00:13:31,823 --> 00:13:35,023
You know how awful it was when Dad went.

258
00:13:35,091 --> 00:13:38,160
So I'm just supposed to be
okay with losing you too?

259
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:43,293
No. I can't hear this.

260
00:13:43,513 --> 00:13:46,076
I can't hear this right now.

261
00:13:54,305 --> 00:13:56,215
She taught high school physics.

262
00:13:56,577 --> 00:13:59,966
She always pushed me to
be rational, ordered,

263
00:14:00,183 --> 00:14:01,634
even as a kid.

264
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:06,513
I've never heard her sound like that.

265
00:14:06,538 --> 00:14:09,100
Are you sure she hasn't been
struggling with depression?

266
00:14:09,221 --> 00:14:11,140
It's been tough since Dad passed,

267
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:13,088
but that's been two years now.

268
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:15,357
I thought she was fine.

269
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:18,878
That is not her.

270
00:14:18,903 --> 00:14:23,006
At her age, there could be some
underlying neurological condition.

271
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:26,206
I'd like to send her to get a
CT scan and cognitive testing.

272
00:14:26,231 --> 00:14:29,689
Something like dementia can cause
extreme personality changes.

273
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:31,215
Yes. Please.

274
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,249
Please do everything you can.

275
00:14:33,621 --> 00:14:36,237
- I will.
- Thank you.

276
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,291
Anything?

277
00:14:45,878 --> 00:14:47,572
Should I try more...

278
00:14:47,597 --> 00:14:51,111
I think we're beyond manual labour.
Time for plan B.

279
00:14:51,136 --> 00:14:53,103
You never said what that was.

280
00:14:53,231 --> 00:14:55,854
We drain it with a needle. Don't worry.

281
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,316
It sounds worse than it is.
We use freezing.

282
00:14:58,953 --> 00:15:01,228
Ugh, can we wait a little longer?

283
00:15:01,253 --> 00:15:04,447
I think if you call my mom, she's
definitely gonna call my dad.

284
00:15:06,317 --> 00:15:08,658
He moved to San Francisco
after they split.

285
00:15:09,030 --> 00:15:11,151
Well, I don't live in the
same city as my kids,

286
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:14,345
and I'd still want to know
what's going on with them.

287
00:15:14,370 --> 00:15:16,127
Do you visit them?

288
00:15:16,503 --> 00:15:17,910
Mine doesn't.

289
00:15:18,515 --> 00:15:19,882
And now...

290
00:15:20,301 --> 00:15:23,548
my mom's gonna blame him
because they were his pills.

291
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:27,761
Which is only gonna give him
more reason not to visit.

292
00:15:29,847 --> 00:15:31,432
Okay.

293
00:15:31,698 --> 00:15:33,600
We can give it a bit longer.

294
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,736
Hey.

295
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:51,076
Are you avoiding me?

296
00:15:52,845 --> 00:15:56,040
First we can't be seen together,
and now I can't smile at you?

297
00:15:57,466 --> 00:16:01,419
Look. When I see you, I smile.
I can't help it.

298
00:16:01,444 --> 00:16:04,714
I just don't want everyone knowing
our business. Okay? So...

299
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,047
Or is it that you're embarrassed
to be dating the help?

300
00:16:09,072 --> 00:16:11,086
Would you stop talking
about yourself like that?

301
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,343
If that's not the problem, then what is?

302
00:16:13,368 --> 00:16:15,393
You really wanna do this now?

303
00:16:16,849 --> 00:16:19,145
Maybe we shouldn't do it at all.

304
00:16:24,693 --> 00:16:26,294
Is that the CT on your found down?

305
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:28,880
Mrs. Joseph. Radiology
reported it's clear.

306
00:16:28,905 --> 00:16:30,622
Next step is to order a psych eval.

307
00:16:30,776 --> 00:16:32,966
You know you're going to
need my sign-off for that.

308
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:35,927
She has chronic kidney disease,
but good support from family

309
00:16:35,952 --> 00:16:37,420
and no other physical issues.

310
00:16:37,445 --> 00:16:39,207
I want to know why she
tried to kill herself.

311
00:16:40,292 --> 00:16:43,880
Well, she's 85. She's ill.

312
00:16:44,365 --> 00:16:46,716
There's a possibility
she may just be ready.

313
00:16:46,827 --> 00:16:50,075
She'll need dialysis in the next
year, but she's far from terminal.

314
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,380
We're all terminal.

315
00:16:51,405 --> 00:16:53,591
It's just a case of when
we figure that out.

316
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:55,286
We owe it to her to be sure.

317
00:16:55,927 --> 00:16:57,802
You know, we do have a policy.

318
00:16:57,827 --> 00:17:00,318
If a case bumps against
a doctor's belief

319
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:02,239
system, -he's allowed to hand it off.

320
00:17:02,264 --> 00:17:04,436
This has nothing to do
with my belief system.

321
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:07,848
It's about making sure that I'm
everything that I can for Mrs. Joseph.

322
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:10,559
And for her daughter, who isn't
ready to lose her mother.

323
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:13,396
Okay, see what psych has to say.

324
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,684
Thank you.

325
00:17:15,113 --> 00:17:18,239
The kid's been in the room for
three hours. I need the bed.

326
00:17:18,264 --> 00:17:19,458
Give him a little longer.

327
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,849
I think you should put him out
of his misery and drain it.

328
00:17:21,874 --> 00:17:24,153
Well, thanks for your opinion.
I'll let you know what I decide.

329
00:17:24,178 --> 00:17:26,685
Is this your priapism? The
kid's afraid of a needle?

330
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,245
I think he's more afraid to
tell his mom he's having sex.

331
00:17:29,653 --> 00:17:32,036
Well, you know we do have a policy.

332
00:17:32,061 --> 00:17:34,323
If a case bumps against a
doctor's belief system,

333
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:36,388
he is allowed to hand it off.

334
00:17:36,413 --> 00:17:38,356
I'm just trying to be his ally.

335
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,317
A minor can make a consent for himself,

336
00:17:41,342 --> 00:17:42,599
as long as you're confident

337
00:17:42,624 --> 00:17:44,582
that he understands the
weight of the decision.

338
00:17:44,607 --> 00:17:48,068
Either way, Claire's right.
What goes up must come down.

339
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,692
Glad I'm not a teenager these days.

340
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:57,161
Glad I never had to raise any.

341
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:59,509
Speaking of, how's yours?

342
00:17:59,534 --> 00:18:01,149
Barely talking to me, as usual.

343
00:18:01,174 --> 00:18:04,042
Oh. Guess it's your move then.

344
00:18:07,613 --> 00:18:09,632
I haven't noticed you fasting.

345
00:18:09,715 --> 00:18:12,083
It isn't Ramadan.
That's a different Eid.

346
00:18:12,128 --> 00:18:14,332
Oh... Hey, mind if I ask you a question?

347
00:18:14,357 --> 00:18:15,371
Mm-hmm.

348
00:18:15,396 --> 00:18:17,068
So there's Christmas
and Easter Christians,

349
00:18:17,093 --> 00:18:19,739
there's Sunday Christians, there's
every day, all day Christians.

350
00:18:19,764 --> 00:18:22,356
Is it kind the same thing with Muslims?

351
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:25,147
- It's complicated.
- But you pray every day?

352
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:30,590
Some days, I pray five times a day.

353
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,946
And some days, I don't pray at all.

354
00:18:51,151 --> 00:18:52,869
I thought you weren't working today.

355
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:54,861
Weren't you supposed to go home?

356
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:56,822
Yeah. I picked up a shift.

357
00:18:56,984 --> 00:19:00,454
Melissa thinks it's hard on the girls
when I'm in and out so quickly.

358
00:19:00,479 --> 00:19:02,002
You know, we decided

359
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:05,021
I should only go back when I
can stay for a longer time.

360
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:07,753
That can't be easy.

361
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:10,860
It's for the best.

362
00:19:12,130 --> 00:19:13,696
I can focus on my work.

363
00:19:19,389 --> 00:19:20,953
Will?

364
00:19:21,455 --> 00:19:24,595
Will! Hey! You're awake!

365
00:19:24,893 --> 00:19:26,684
Oh, thank God!

366
00:19:27,996 --> 00:19:30,268
About earlier I... I don't...

367
00:19:30,293 --> 00:19:33,506
Don't say anything.

368
00:19:36,146 --> 00:19:38,012
Just don't go.

369
00:19:38,651 --> 00:19:40,346
I won't.

370
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:46,311
Will. I love you.

371
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:49,230
Will?

372
00:19:49,255 --> 00:19:50,858
Will?

373
00:19:51,942 --> 00:19:53,576
Will, hey! Help!

374
00:19:53,601 --> 00:19:55,321
Help, help, help!

375
00:19:55,346 --> 00:19:57,113
I need help in here!

376
00:19:57,879 --> 00:20:00,509
Pressure's tanking. What happened?
Is he seizing?

377
00:20:00,534 --> 00:20:02,330
He was awake for one
second then he wasn't.

378
00:20:02,355 --> 00:20:03,814
Ma'am, I need you to step back.

379
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,283
Looks more like decorticate posturing.

380
00:20:05,308 --> 00:20:06,384
Intracranial hemorrhaging?

381
00:20:06,409 --> 00:20:08,775
We checked his whole body, there
was no sign of head trauma.

382
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,235
We need to intubate, get him to CT.
Repeat his blood work.

383
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:12,971
- Prep 30 etomidate, 100 sux.
- Got it.

384
00:20:12,996 --> 00:20:14,260
His INR levels were elevated but

385
00:20:14,285 --> 00:20:16,244
within range for a trauma
patient with coagulopathy.

386
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:18,009
What are you thinking, blood thinners?

387
00:20:18,034 --> 00:20:19,330
Well, if he's on them, he's gonna bleed.

388
00:20:19,355 --> 00:20:21,783
Even the slightest bump to his
head could trigger a hemorrhage.

389
00:20:21,808 --> 00:20:24,198
Lucy, you said that Will wasn't
taking any medication. Are you sure?

390
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,040
But if there's any chance he
was taking blood thinners,

391
00:20:26,065 --> 00:20:27,103
we need to know now.

392
00:20:27,128 --> 00:20:30,522
We... We haven't been
together for five months.

393
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,627
I left him.

394
00:20:35,812 --> 00:20:38,790
I'm not going to admit
Lena Joseph to psychiatry.

395
00:20:38,815 --> 00:20:41,417
She wants to die, that
means she's depressed.

396
00:20:41,658 --> 00:20:43,759
Not in the way I choose
to treat clinically.

397
00:20:43,795 --> 00:20:45,174
Is this about her age?

398
00:20:45,199 --> 00:20:47,518
Would you say the same
thing if she was 20?

399
00:20:47,543 --> 00:20:49,556
Maybe not. But that's my point.

400
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,705
You see, most of what we do here
is artificially prolonging life.

401
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:55,650
Resuscitation,
catheterization, surgery...

402
00:20:55,675 --> 00:20:58,883
She's wrestling with this because
she's in her 80s and ill.

403
00:20:58,908 --> 00:21:00,322
It would be a mistake to apply

404
00:21:00,347 --> 00:21:03,415
a black and white stance to
a more nuanced situation.

405
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,603
I don't consider wanting to
help her taking a stance,

406
00:21:05,628 --> 00:21:07,571
I consider it my responsibility, doctor.

407
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,146
Wanting to control the way
we go out isn't uncommon.

408
00:21:11,713 --> 00:21:13,712
Look, as her primary physician,

409
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:16,228
you can keep her in a
72-hour psych hold,

410
00:21:16,253 --> 00:21:17,728
but if it was just up to me?

411
00:21:17,753 --> 00:21:20,244
I'd cut her loose as soon as
she's physically ready to go.

412
00:21:20,269 --> 00:21:22,096
Well, then I'm glad it isn't up to you.

413
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:26,157
You're the doctor from Syria? Yeah?

414
00:21:26,328 --> 00:21:28,563
I treat a lot of patients
who come from war zones.

415
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,022
We just met, so this is not a judgment,

416
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:33,009
but if you ever need to talk to someone,

417
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:34,557
feel free to reach out.

418
00:21:48,728 --> 00:21:51,830
Don't you have a fancy coffee
machine in your office?

419
00:21:51,853 --> 00:21:53,517
Well, I'm a man of the people, Claire.

420
00:21:53,542 --> 00:21:55,658
Of course, and by that you
mean another egomaniac

421
00:21:55,683 --> 00:21:57,048
doctor who knows everything?

422
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:58,962
Well, yeah.

423
00:21:58,987 --> 00:22:01,150
But if you're still holding a
grudge against Dr. Hunter,

424
00:22:01,175 --> 00:22:03,907
- then you shouldn't because he's...
- A good guy?

425
00:22:03,932 --> 00:22:06,064
Do you want me to talk to him?

426
00:22:06,089 --> 00:22:07,970
Uh, no. No, it wasn't a big deal.

427
00:22:07,995 --> 00:22:09,854
And you know I can fight my own battles.

428
00:22:09,879 --> 00:22:12,041
Of that, I am well aware.

429
00:22:13,313 --> 00:22:14,939
Is that it? You just came to tell me

430
00:22:14,964 --> 00:22:16,915
all the different ways in
which I disappoint you?

431
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,166
And that I changed my mind.

432
00:22:19,191 --> 00:22:20,463
About Theo?

433
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:21,855
About dinner.

434
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:24,845
You asked me the other day.

435
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:26,430
Tonight?

436
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:29,298
Tomorrow. And I'm buying.

437
00:22:29,418 --> 00:22:31,330
I just got an offer on the house.

438
00:22:31,756 --> 00:22:33,520
You're selling your mother's house?

439
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:35,511
You love that house.

440
00:22:35,536 --> 00:22:38,775
Well, I've been letting go
of a few things lately.

441
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:43,613
Well, I'll book us a table.
Somewhere expensive.

442
00:22:45,758 --> 00:22:48,670
Right now, we're balancing
two opposing problems.

443
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:50,763
Will's abdominal injury from the bullet,

444
00:22:50,788 --> 00:22:53,703
and the brain bleed, which is what
caused him to lose consciousness.

445
00:22:53,728 --> 00:22:55,259
Can you fix them?

446
00:22:55,284 --> 00:22:56,712
Individually, yes.

447
00:22:56,737 --> 00:23:00,029
But they both require
equally emergent surgeries.

448
00:23:00,811 --> 00:23:02,116
There are risks either way,

449
00:23:02,141 --> 00:23:05,280
but the surgeons will want you
to weigh in on who goes first.

450
00:23:05,349 --> 00:23:07,017
They want me to decide?

451
00:23:07,295 --> 00:23:08,998
Well, even if you're separated,

452
00:23:09,023 --> 00:23:11,756
while legally married, you're
still his next of kin.

453
00:23:11,781 --> 00:23:13,152
But you said he was stable.

454
00:23:13,177 --> 00:23:15,436
Blood thinners make your
blood less likely to clot.

455
00:23:15,647 --> 00:23:18,607
Which makes you more susceptible
to internal bleeds.

456
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:21,843
- There are precautions, but...
- But you didn't know.

457
00:23:22,673 --> 00:23:24,107
Will's had a tough year.

458
00:23:24,464 --> 00:23:29,368
His father had all these
heart problems and um...

459
00:23:30,311 --> 00:23:32,077
I cheated on him.

460
00:23:32,304 --> 00:23:34,580
We met up today, and he...

461
00:23:35,223 --> 00:23:37,083
said he forgave me.

462
00:23:38,464 --> 00:23:40,378
That he still loved me.

463
00:23:41,963 --> 00:23:43,715
But I didn't say it back.

464
00:23:44,989 --> 00:23:46,198
Not until just now,

465
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:48,719
when I saw him, and he
needed to hear me say it.

466
00:23:50,633 --> 00:23:52,237
But it wasn't true.

467
00:23:53,728 --> 00:23:55,811
- You can do this.
- No.

468
00:23:55,929 --> 00:23:58,063
I'm the one that keeps on hurting him.

469
00:23:58,357 --> 00:24:01,190
How can I be the one making
decisions about his life?

470
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,503
You decide.

471
00:24:03,528 --> 00:24:05,706
No. I can walk you through
the options, but I can't...

472
00:24:05,731 --> 00:24:07,238
Please.

473
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:10,450
We'll do this together.

474
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,628
I'm sorry. I can't.

475
00:24:35,107 --> 00:24:38,052
Hey. Are you okay?

476
00:24:38,114 --> 00:24:39,448
You're sweating.

477
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:41,467
He could die, and she could just...

478
00:24:41,621 --> 00:24:43,506
How could she just walk away?

479
00:24:44,162 --> 00:24:46,553
Listen. It's not our job to
make her a stronger person.

480
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:49,256
Alright? Did you find out why her
husband's on blood thinners?

481
00:24:49,342 --> 00:24:50,834
She didn't know.

482
00:24:52,787 --> 00:24:54,584
I think I might, though.

483
00:24:54,684 --> 00:24:56,330
And deep breath in.

484
00:24:58,027 --> 00:25:01,607
What happens now? Are you
gonna let me go home?

485
00:25:01,632 --> 00:25:03,754
Not until I'm sure you're ready.

486
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:07,841
Until you're sure I won't
do it again, you mean.

487
00:25:11,803 --> 00:25:14,248
Your daughter is very
concerned about you.

488
00:25:14,434 --> 00:25:16,307
You think I'm selfish.

489
00:25:16,669 --> 00:25:19,518
If I was your mother,
you'd be upset too.

490
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,327
I watched the sacrifices Erin made

491
00:25:22,352 --> 00:25:24,753
to be with her father
through his illness.

492
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,651
It just seemed like...

493
00:25:27,384 --> 00:25:31,323
if I was ready anyway, why
wouldn't I spare her that?

494
00:25:31,610 --> 00:25:34,992
In my experience, people don't
always want to be spared.

495
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:38,329
Tell me the OR's ready for him.

496
00:25:38,354 --> 00:25:39,837
Well, neurosurgery and Trauma

497
00:25:39,862 --> 00:25:41,924
are both saying their
needs are priority. So...

498
00:25:41,949 --> 00:25:43,587
And his wife walked away.

499
00:25:45,497 --> 00:25:47,198
Then I make the call.

500
00:25:48,750 --> 00:25:51,259
Between two terrible options.

501
00:25:53,071 --> 00:25:56,900
Unless there's a third that
I'm not smart enough to see.

502
00:25:57,545 --> 00:25:59,309
Well, actually there is.

503
00:26:00,336 --> 00:26:01,970
Will's father had a heart attack.

504
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,524
- So you did get a history?
- No, it was more like a confession.

505
00:26:04,549 --> 00:26:07,204
But turns out Will has a family
history of heart problems,

506
00:26:07,229 --> 00:26:09,306
which may be why he's on blood thinners.

507
00:26:09,331 --> 00:26:10,719
His INR is two,

508
00:26:10,744 --> 00:26:12,267
so he's more likely to be on Coumadin

509
00:26:12,292 --> 00:26:14,009
than any of the newer anti-coags.

510
00:26:14,034 --> 00:26:15,688
And if we dose him with vitamin K

511
00:26:15,713 --> 00:26:17,360
and a prothrombin complex concentrate,

512
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,962
then we can reverse his
propensity to bleed.

513
00:26:19,987 --> 00:26:21,373
That could buy time.

514
00:26:21,456 --> 00:26:24,611
Neuro could go in, start the
craniotomy, relieve the clot,

515
00:26:24,636 --> 00:26:27,378
then Trauma can take over and
fix the intra-abdo bleed.

516
00:26:28,505 --> 00:26:31,048
Get the surgeons talking
to each other. Go.

517
00:26:42,552 --> 00:26:45,444
Oh, uh... Sorry. I'm sorry.

518
00:26:45,469 --> 00:26:47,231
Are you okay?

519
00:27:01,522 --> 00:27:02,964
- Hey.
- Hey.

520
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:04,090
You looking for someone?

521
00:27:04,115 --> 00:27:05,130
My little sister.

522
00:27:05,155 --> 00:27:07,404
She's supposed to be
here doing her homework.

523
00:27:07,429 --> 00:27:09,379
Homework on a Saturday?

524
00:27:09,404 --> 00:27:11,677
Girl after my own heart.

525
00:27:11,702 --> 00:27:13,425
Bathroom, maybe?

526
00:27:13,906 --> 00:27:15,761
Yeah, probably.

527
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:19,056
Seriously, I don't know how you do it.

528
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:21,903
This job, and taking
care of your sister...

529
00:27:21,928 --> 00:27:24,489
I mean, I barely remember
to eat until four.

530
00:27:24,514 --> 00:27:26,688
I wouldn't exactly call that a meal.

531
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:30,775
Did I see you checking your pulse?

532
00:27:32,130 --> 00:27:35,071
It's just an intense day.

533
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,140
Want me to help you look for her?

534
00:27:37,165 --> 00:27:39,520
Yeah, oh...

535
00:27:40,723 --> 00:27:43,301
Um... it seems Arnold already found her.

536
00:27:43,326 --> 00:27:44,997
Excellent.

537
00:27:45,657 --> 00:27:47,725
This young lady says
she's related to you?

538
00:27:47,750 --> 00:27:50,582
She's supposed to be related
to me in the cafeteria.

539
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,046
Thank you.

540
00:27:56,489 --> 00:27:58,215
You promised me you wouldn't move.

541
00:27:58,248 --> 00:27:59,411
I know.

542
00:27:59,436 --> 00:28:01,809
This isn't a playground, Amira.
This is my job.

543
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:03,349
I know.

544
00:28:03,696 --> 00:28:05,560
What's wrong?

545
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:08,187
I just wanted to remember how it felt.

546
00:28:09,284 --> 00:28:12,192
When Mama and Baba
would take me to work.

547
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:14,477
It's Eid.

548
00:28:14,772 --> 00:28:16,918
We're all supposed to be together.

549
00:28:17,306 --> 00:28:21,326
You never talk about them. I'm
afraid I'm going to forget.

550
00:28:23,377 --> 00:28:25,137
Is this the famous sister?

551
00:28:25,162 --> 00:28:28,665
Amira. This is my boss, Dr. Bishop.

552
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,641
Very nice to meet you.

553
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:34,202
She was just headed back to the
cafeteria to finish her homework.

554
00:28:34,227 --> 00:28:35,928
Oh, fantastic. So was I.

555
00:28:35,953 --> 00:28:37,591
Not to do homework, obviously.

556
00:28:37,616 --> 00:28:38,957
I was gonna use my privileges

557
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:41,273
to see if I could swing
some free snacks.

558
00:28:41,298 --> 00:28:42,556
Interested?

559
00:28:46,092 --> 00:28:48,817
Come on. I guess your
brother has to work.

560
00:28:56,848 --> 00:29:00,685
She's been awake since this
started, but feeling off.

561
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:02,311
I'm cycling her BP.

562
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:05,247
She said she felt light-headed,
then that monitor started beeping.

563
00:29:05,272 --> 00:29:08,012
Page cardiology. Wide
complex tachycardia.

564
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:09,848
Let's start an Amiodarone infusion.

565
00:29:09,873 --> 00:29:11,559
- Okay.
- Okay.

566
00:29:14,874 --> 00:29:18,973
What you are experiencing is
called ventricular tachycardia.

567
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:20,434
It's an irregular heartbeat

568
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:24,012
likely brought on by electrolyte
abnormalities from not eating,

569
00:29:24,037 --> 00:29:26,661
coupled with our
interventions earlier today.

570
00:29:26,686 --> 00:29:27,926
Can you stop it?

571
00:29:27,951 --> 00:29:31,434
She'll need an angiogram
and we'll run medications.

572
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:32,692
If she becomes unstable,

573
00:29:32,717 --> 00:29:36,271
then we'll shock her heart
to restore a normal rhythm.

574
00:29:36,296 --> 00:29:37,777
No.

575
00:29:39,112 --> 00:29:41,192
I thought you wanted to come home.

576
00:29:41,415 --> 00:29:45,129
No honey, you wanted me to.

577
00:29:45,287 --> 00:29:48,623
And I was willing to do it for you.

578
00:29:48,746 --> 00:29:53,153
But if Dr. Hamed is saying
this could be it...

579
00:29:53,178 --> 00:29:54,779
What would happen to her then?

580
00:29:55,028 --> 00:29:59,082
Without medications or an intervention
to reset her heart rhythm,

581
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:03,710
you'll... you'll likely go
into cardiac arrest and die.

582
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:05,929
No.

583
00:30:07,028 --> 00:30:09,503
Please, honey.

584
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:12,457
This is what I want.

585
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:19,215
You need to save her.

586
00:30:27,415 --> 00:30:29,672
Is there where *** come?

587
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:31,931
The trauma bay, yes.

588
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,572
That's where we do what's
called extreme measures

589
00:30:34,597 --> 00:30:36,775
to try to save people's lives.

590
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:38,744
Does my brother do that?

591
00:30:38,769 --> 00:30:40,580
Well, I'll deny it if
you tell him I said so,

592
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,800
but he's practically an expert.

593
00:30:43,734 --> 00:30:45,435
Our parents were doctors.

594
00:30:45,460 --> 00:30:47,814
They had a hospital in Syria before...

595
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:50,100
before we came here.

596
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,760
I never brought my son to the hospital.

597
00:30:52,785 --> 00:30:54,275
Maybe I should have.

598
00:30:54,387 --> 00:30:56,213
Definitely you should have.

599
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:58,149
Okay.

600
00:30:59,549 --> 00:31:02,399
I can let you consent to
the procedure on your own,

601
00:31:02,424 --> 00:31:04,174
but if you don't want
talk to your parents,

602
00:31:04,199 --> 00:31:05,831
you need to talk to me first.

603
00:31:06,388 --> 00:31:08,760
That girl you were going to meet...

604
00:31:08,785 --> 00:31:09,994
she your girlfriend?

605
00:31:10,019 --> 00:31:12,384
What, like, you mean going steady?

606
00:31:13,396 --> 00:31:15,464
She's a girl I know from school.

607
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:17,330
Were you planning on using protection?

608
00:31:17,355 --> 00:31:18,978
She said she's on the pill.

609
00:31:19,003 --> 00:31:21,322
- Not good enough.
- Alright, okay?

610
00:31:21,347 --> 00:31:22,978
I'll use a condom.

611
00:31:23,003 --> 00:31:24,509
What about the pill you took?

612
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,205
Wanna explain to me why you did that?

613
00:31:26,361 --> 00:31:29,416
I just wanted to last.

614
00:31:30,324 --> 00:31:32,814
My friends say they can
go for 30 minutes.

615
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,267
Your friends are lying.

616
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:37,395
Ten minutes is normal, no matter
what the internet tells you.

617
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:41,192
More importantly, if you have to
take a pill to impress a girl,

618
00:31:41,217 --> 00:31:43,251
she's not the right girl.

619
00:31:43,305 --> 00:31:46,971
You're telling me every girl you've
been with was the right one?

620
00:31:46,996 --> 00:31:48,330
I am.

621
00:31:48,761 --> 00:31:52,017
Because there's only been one,
and I'm still married to her.

622
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:54,822
One girl? This whole time?=

623
00:31:54,847 --> 00:31:56,330
Thirteen years and counting.

624
00:31:56,355 --> 00:31:59,002
And you're trying to teach me about sex?

625
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,088
How do you even know anything?

626
00:32:03,613 --> 00:32:05,267
Well, I know...

627
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:08,588
that decisions have consequences.

628
00:32:10,696 --> 00:32:13,016
You're going to want
to take a deep breath.

629
00:32:18,189 --> 00:32:21,899
She's still in v-tach. Cardioversion
is the only other option.

630
00:32:22,439 --> 00:32:25,557
She requested a DNR and you
want to reset her heart?

631
00:32:25,582 --> 00:32:27,744
There's still a case for a psych hold,

632
00:32:27,769 --> 00:32:29,711
which would grant her
daughter power of attorney,

633
00:32:29,736 --> 00:32:30,981
so we can avoid the DNR.

634
00:32:31,006 --> 00:32:33,416
Well, Lena Joseph is your
patient, not her daughter.

635
00:32:33,441 --> 00:32:35,205
It's her wishes you'd be dismissing.

636
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:37,264
No, it's her I'd be giving up on.

637
00:32:42,317 --> 00:32:44,051
You're a man of instinct.

638
00:32:44,251 --> 00:32:47,217
I know you can make hard
choices and save lives.

639
00:32:49,313 --> 00:32:51,553
That's not what you've
been asked to do here.

640
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,851
Could be a couple of hours...

641
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,852
no more than a day.

642
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:02,606
I thought we were on the same side.

643
00:33:03,227 --> 00:33:04,942
We are.

644
00:33:05,524 --> 00:33:06,944
Hers.

645
00:33:09,061 --> 00:33:13,326
I know it's hard, but we have to
respect your mother's wishes.

646
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:19,624
If I just had more time,

647
00:33:21,112 --> 00:33:23,962
I could make her see I
don't care if it's hard.

648
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,215
I just don't wanna lose her.

649
00:33:36,387 --> 00:33:38,434
Now there's nothing I can do.

650
00:33:41,336 --> 00:33:43,314
But there is something you can do.

651
00:33:46,822 --> 00:33:49,644
You can take the chance to say goodbye.

652
00:33:52,765 --> 00:33:54,617
My parents...

653
00:33:59,033 --> 00:34:01,457
My parents both died suddenly.

654
00:34:02,397 --> 00:34:05,377
Long before I was ready to let them go.

655
00:34:08,727 --> 00:34:12,958
This may not be the way that
you want to say goodbye,

656
00:34:12,983 --> 00:34:15,179
but this time that you
have with her is a gift,

657
00:34:16,129 --> 00:34:18,390
if you choose to see it that way.

658
00:34:35,103 --> 00:34:36,380
Hey

659
00:34:36,405 --> 00:34:39,867
I shouldn't have left. It
was the wrong thing to do.

660
00:34:39,892 --> 00:34:41,512
Things just got so messed up, I...

661
00:34:41,542 --> 00:34:43,598
Is he... is he okay?

662
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,934
He's in surgery.

663
00:34:44,959 --> 00:34:47,360
We were able to reverse the
effects of the blood thinners

664
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,677
and stabilize him for both operations.

665
00:34:49,783 --> 00:34:51,411
So he's going to make it?

666
00:34:51,436 --> 00:34:52,942
It's too soon to tell,

667
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,301
but the surgeons felt that
the risk was acceptable,

668
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:56,825
given the alternative.

669
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:01,184
When he wakes up, and when he's ready...

670
00:35:02,591 --> 00:35:04,435
I'm going to tell him
that he deserves to be

671
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,032
with someone who loves him back.

672
00:35:06,057 --> 00:35:08,574
<i>Code Blue, OR 2. Code Blue, OR 2.</i>

673
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:10,497
Wait over here.

674
00:35:33,442 --> 00:35:35,607
As your rhythm continues to deteriorate,

675
00:35:35,632 --> 00:35:38,006
you may feel the need for
more pain management.

676
00:35:38,031 --> 00:35:39,972
Let us know if that's the case.

677
00:35:41,797 --> 00:35:43,364
Honey.

678
00:35:47,045 --> 00:35:49,920
I know this isn't easy for you.

679
00:35:50,707 --> 00:35:53,795
We'll be back to check you
have everything that you need.

680
00:35:53,913 --> 00:35:55,756
There is one thing.

681
00:35:58,198 --> 00:36:00,201
My goulash recipe.

682
00:36:00,856 --> 00:36:03,329
I need to pass it on.

683
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:07,624
You always said you'd
take that to your grave.

684
00:36:07,786 --> 00:36:09,794
And here we are.

685
00:36:15,488 --> 00:36:18,136
We could use a pen and paper.

686
00:36:23,491 --> 00:36:27,312
Mom, none of this is rational, you know?

687
00:36:27,526 --> 00:36:30,412
Some things just aren't.

688
00:36:57,779 --> 00:36:59,120
Hey.

689
00:36:59,295 --> 00:37:00,713
What are you doing right now?

690
00:37:00,738 --> 00:37:03,613
- Nothing, why?
- I need a favour

691
00:37:03,833 --> 00:37:06,017
We did everything we could.

692
00:37:09,381 --> 00:37:11,564
But in spite of our best effort...

693
00:37:13,615 --> 00:37:15,776
Will didn't survive his surgery.

694
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:21,406
Will's dead?

695
00:37:22,792 --> 00:37:24,619
He fought really hard, Lucy.

696
00:37:26,668 --> 00:37:29,846
But in the end, both
injuries were just...

697
00:37:29,871 --> 00:37:31,363
they were too much for him to handle.

698
00:37:31,388 --> 00:37:33,666
You said he was going to be okay!

699
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:40,189
How... How am I supposed to live
with things ending this way?

700
00:37:43,285 --> 00:37:47,150
I trusted you, and you didn't save him!

701
00:37:57,345 --> 00:38:00,166
Maybe if we'd looked twice
at his elevated INR...

702
00:38:00,191 --> 00:38:01,472
Don't do that. Alright?

703
00:38:01,497 --> 00:38:03,667
You did everything medically
possible to help that man.

704
00:38:03,692 --> 00:38:05,250
You even tried saving his marriage.

705
00:38:05,889 --> 00:38:08,190
She was upset. Her husband just died.

706
00:38:08,215 --> 00:38:10,381
You can't control the
way she reacts to that.

707
00:38:10,406 --> 00:38:11,987
Dr. Curtis isn't wrong.

708
00:38:12,475 --> 00:38:14,418
It was out of our control.

709
00:38:14,847 --> 00:38:16,515
That's the job.

710
00:38:17,005 --> 00:38:19,830
We move on and focus on
the things we can fix.

711
00:38:19,855 --> 00:38:22,331
Oh, God!

712
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:26,393
- Uh...
- Charlie, don't move!

713
00:38:26,418 --> 00:38:28,884
I'm sorry, sir. He
just got away from me.

714
00:38:28,909 --> 00:38:30,807
- You okay, Charlie?
- Don't move, don't move.

715
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,620
- I'm good! I'm good!
- No, no, no!

716
00:38:32,645 --> 00:38:35,236
Whoa, whoa! Okay! Not so good!

717
00:38:36,142 --> 00:38:37,771
Welcome back, Charlie.

718
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,127
Try to stay with him this time, Lou.

719
00:38:40,596 --> 00:38:42,705
Okay... Where does it hurt?

720
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:44,752
You know I'm not
embarrassed of you, right?

721
00:38:44,777 --> 00:38:46,837
But you don't want anyone
knowing about us, though.

722
00:38:46,862 --> 00:38:48,268
It's nobody's business.

723
00:38:48,293 --> 00:38:52,290
Mm... So we can only be together when...

724
00:38:52,402 --> 00:38:54,002
nobody's around?

725
00:38:54,027 --> 00:38:56,525
You want me to tell everyone
you're my boyfriend?

726
00:39:00,034 --> 00:39:03,314
Fine. He's my goddamn boyfriend.
You happy?

727
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:06,330
What? 'Cause you told Charlie?
No offence Charlie.

728
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:07,900
That's okay.

729
00:39:08,025 --> 00:39:11,427
I mean, I... I got a
goddamn girlfriend too.

730
00:39:12,047 --> 00:39:15,354
I can't find her though. She
got snakes in her veins.

731
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:17,380
- Snakes in her veins?
- Yeah.

732
00:39:17,405 --> 00:39:19,448
- Just like me.
- Means an IV?

733
00:39:20,177 --> 00:39:22,235
Is your girlfriend a patient here?

734
00:39:22,524 --> 00:39:24,440
Is that who you've been looking for?

735
00:39:24,465 --> 00:39:26,198
Obviously.

736
00:39:27,465 --> 00:39:29,785
Any shortness of breath now?

737
00:39:29,859 --> 00:39:31,287
No.

738
00:39:32,923 --> 00:39:35,124
But I felt something earlier today.

739
00:39:36,865 --> 00:39:38,585
Rhythm looks good now.

740
00:39:38,915 --> 00:39:40,671
What were you doing at the time?

741
00:39:40,696 --> 00:39:42,966
Managing the wife of a critical patient.

742
00:39:43,563 --> 00:39:45,068
We lost him.

743
00:39:46,259 --> 00:39:48,190
I've been living with
this long enough to know

744
00:39:48,215 --> 00:39:50,284
that my symptoms can
sometimes be psychological

745
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,526
They can also be physiological.

746
00:39:52,551 --> 00:39:54,861
- Yes.
- The only way for me to know

747
00:39:54,886 --> 00:39:58,314
is to see you more regularly,
and get a fuller picture.

748
00:40:00,286 --> 00:40:02,481
Every time I come here,
I feel like the...

749
00:40:02,506 --> 00:40:04,552
Like the sick little
kid everyone worried

750
00:40:04,577 --> 00:40:06,489
would never be strong enough.

751
00:40:06,514 --> 00:40:09,367
That's why it's so important
to be on top of this.

752
00:40:09,529 --> 00:40:11,894
So you don't have to be that kid again.

753
00:40:16,509 --> 00:40:17,960
Jonah, I...

754
00:40:17,985 --> 00:40:20,502
I wanted to see... how you are.

755
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,809
There's something I need to tell you.

756
00:40:26,179 --> 00:40:30,149
Do young people even check
their voicemails these days?

757
00:40:30,174 --> 00:40:31,770
I'll send yoa text.

758
00:40:31,795 --> 00:40:33,286
It's your father.

759
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:47,213
Am I doing it right now?

760
00:40:47,238 --> 00:40:48,805
Uh, yeah.

761
00:40:49,100 --> 00:40:51,067
Do you think it's ready?

762
00:40:51,105 --> 00:40:52,973
Uh, no keep stirring.

763
00:40:52,998 --> 00:40:54,461
Almost.

764
00:41:03,986 --> 00:41:06,526
- Eid Mubarak!
- Lamb! Bash!

765
00:41:06,551 --> 00:41:08,836
Dr. Hunter brought lamb!

766
00:41:11,142 --> 00:41:13,276
But every butcher I called was sold out!

767
00:41:13,301 --> 00:41:15,680
Us country boys have our connections.

768
00:41:15,705 --> 00:41:17,563
It's called Costco. Haha.

769
00:41:17,588 --> 00:41:19,524
It's Halal, I swear.

770
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,399
Shukraan, Theo. Come on in.

771
00:41:23,728 --> 00:41:27,069
You are saying that you haven't
seen either one of them?

772
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,633
I always fall asleep.

773
00:41:29,898 --> 00:41:31,500
If I had to pick one...

774
00:41:31,684 --> 00:41:33,208
An impossible question.

775
00:41:33,233 --> 00:41:35,798
The first is the perfect horror film.

776
00:41:35,823 --> 00:41:38,283
The second is the ultimate action movie.

777
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:42,473
He made me watch them both,

778
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:44,698
honestly I thought they
were the same movie.

779
00:41:44,738 --> 00:41:46,255
Bashir...

780
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,097
Brother, sometimes I don't
know how we are friends.

781
00:41:51,948 --> 00:41:54,129
Theo, are you not enjoying the food?

782
00:41:54,154 --> 00:41:56,191
- Excuse me.
- Take some more!

783
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,186
When you were three years old,

784
00:42:11,211 --> 00:42:13,886
you'd wake up at dawn every morning.

785
00:42:14,856 --> 00:42:17,553
Mama and Baba were
working and exhausted,

786
00:42:17,578 --> 00:42:21,491
but one of them would always get
up early and play with you,

787
00:42:21,516 --> 00:42:23,150
or take you for a walk.

788
00:42:23,753 --> 00:42:25,296
They did?

789
00:42:25,423 --> 00:42:28,592
When you finally started sleeping in,

790
00:42:28,839 --> 00:42:31,358
I would sometimes catch
them up early, just...

791
00:42:31,383 --> 00:42:33,011
sitting beside you.

792
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:35,220
Watching you.

793
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:38,890
Mama once told me that...

794
00:42:38,915 --> 00:42:41,227
no matter how tired she was,

795
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:44,896
it was always her favourite
way to greet the morning.
