Who was that guy?

181
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:09,778
Hmm?

182
00:08:09,978 --> 00:08:11,382
That's my father.

183
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,671
Okay.

184
00:08:13,108 --> 00:08:14,875
He's not a patient here, is he?

185
00:08:14,999 --> 00:08:16,266
Is everything okay?

186
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,398
Apart from being a giant prick?

187
00:08:19,563 --> 00:08:22,023
He has stomach cancer and
Singh's his surgeon.

188
00:08:22,332 --> 00:08:25,625
Okay, so your father's sick
and your boss is his surgeon?

189
00:08:25,650 --> 00:08:27,225
Why wouldn't you tell
me something like that?

190
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,922
I told you that my dad and I
don't talk.

191
00:08:28,947 --> 00:08:30,564
Which means you and I
don't either?

192
00:08:32,152 --> 00:08:33,386
Look, June,

193
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:35,346
I get that your
relationship's messed up,

194
00:08:35,371 --> 00:08:37,033
and you don't like to talk about it.

195
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,814
But you can't just shut me out
of big chunks of your life.

196
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,244
It makes me feel like you
don't want me in it at all.

197
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:44,939
Lou, trust me.
I'm doing you a favor, okay?

198
00:08:44,964 --> 00:08:47,478
- That guy...
- Well, maybe I don't need you to.

199
00:08:50,409 --> 00:08:51,572
Lou!

200
00:08:58,642 --> 00:09:00,976
Excuse me, Doctor?
I'm, uh, Jason.

201
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,268
Sonja Jessup's husband.

202
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:03,694
Bashir Hamed.

203
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:06,257
Uh, she said she was rear-ended.

204
00:09:06,282 --> 00:09:07,950
- Is that true?
- Yes.

205
00:09:08,309 --> 00:09:10,601
And she's, um, she's okay?

206
00:09:10,626 --> 00:09:13,027
We're running some tests
to make sure.

207
00:09:13,358 --> 00:09:15,203
Uh, Dr. Hamed,

208
00:09:15,228 --> 00:09:18,562
did Sonja ask you for painkillers?

209
00:09:18,923 --> 00:09:20,991
She's managing fine.

210
00:09:21,677 --> 00:09:24,476
If she does ask for some,

211
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:26,078
please don't give her any.

212
00:09:26,103 --> 00:09:27,710
Sir?

213
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,641
My wife's an opioid addict.

214
00:09:31,888 --> 00:09:33,889
She's been clean six months.

215
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:36,648
It's important you don't
even offer her any.

216
00:09:38,188 --> 00:09:39,722
Thank you.

217
00:09:40,575 --> 00:09:43,648
♪

218
00:09:48,602 --> 00:09:50,031
Thank you.

219
00:09:54,735 --> 00:09:56,138
Mags?

220
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,058
Does this CT look normal to you?

221
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,773
Yeah.

222
00:10:02,153 --> 00:10:04,336
Yeah, I don't think your
patient sustained head trauma.

223
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:05,859
Doesn't seem like it
from her scan,

224
00:10:05,884 --> 00:10:07,685
but she passed out
during the physical exam

225
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:09,898
- and her respiratory rate is low.
- You have a theory?

226
00:10:09,923 --> 00:10:13,140
Her husband just told me
she's had problems with opioids.

227
00:10:13,507 --> 00:10:15,011
Did you run blood work?

228
00:10:15,036 --> 00:10:17,827
Labs aren't back yet,
but according to her chart,

229
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,084
she was here a couple of
times eight months ago

230
00:10:21,109 --> 00:10:23,124
requesting narcotics for back pain.

231
00:10:23,149 --> 00:10:25,437
The last doctor she saw here
wouldn't prescribe any.

232
00:10:25,462 --> 00:10:26,918
Did she ask for any today?

233
00:10:26,943 --> 00:10:28,890
No, even though
she's clearly in pain.

234
00:10:28,915 --> 00:10:30,499
She probably knows
that she's flagged.

235
00:10:30,533 --> 00:10:32,257
Doesn't wanna draw attention to it.

236
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:36,572
Decreased resp rate, losing
consciousness, no head trauma?

237
00:10:36,613 --> 00:10:38,369
Her husband said
she's clean now.

238
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:41,516
Still, it's kind of tough to ignore
what those symptoms are saying

239
00:10:41,562 --> 00:10:43,531
That she's using again.

240
00:10:51,103 --> 00:10:55,732
I called the surgeons who
repaired Mr. Kowalski's hernia.

241
00:10:55,757 --> 00:10:58,283
Bet they called their lawyer
as soon as you hung up.

242
00:10:58,711 --> 00:11:00,427
Wife and kids are downstairs.

243
00:11:00,452 --> 00:11:03,293
She said she tried to get him come
over but he kept pulling it off.

244
00:11:03,318 --> 00:11:07,036
Speaking of your father's on the
board for his gastrectomy today.

245
00:11:07,138 --> 00:11:08,406
You're welcome to observe.

246
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:10,108
Obviously, we can't
have you scrubbing in,

247
00:11:10,133 --> 00:11:11,533
- but...
- No, thank you.

248
00:11:11,558 --> 00:11:14,167
Understood. Better stay busy.

249
00:11:14,651 --> 00:11:17,520
You'll have plenty to do
once your dad's home anyway.

250
00:11:17,948 --> 00:11:19,274
He said how grateful he was

251
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,675
you're willing to look after him.

252
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,631
He told you
he was staying with me?

253
00:11:24,656 --> 00:11:26,370
Pretty sure my wife and daughter would

254
00:11:26,395 --> 00:11:29,503
pay someone to take me off their hands.

255
00:11:36,712 --> 00:11:39,229
Urology should be down
as soon as they can.

256
00:11:39,254 --> 00:11:40,487
Okay, any pain here?

257
00:11:40,512 --> 00:11:43,381
(MOANING) It was way
worse the first time.

258
00:11:43,406 --> 00:11:45,416
You've dislocated it before?

259
00:11:45,765 --> 00:11:48,000
- When?
- Last year.

260
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:50,373
I was reaching into the crawlspace.

261
00:11:50,499 --> 00:11:52,268
My husband took one look
at it dangling there

262
00:11:52,293 --> 00:11:55,432
and almost fainted.
Ex-husband I should say.

263
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:58,283
I'm still not used to
saying that out loud.

264
00:11:58,933 --> 00:12:01,174
Surgery to repair my bladder.

265
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:04,010
Scale of one-to-ten,
how big a deal is it?

266
00:12:04,035 --> 00:12:07,404
It's laparoscopic, so recovery
shouldn't be too bad.

267
00:12:07,429 --> 00:12:11,377
But having a friend or family member
around is always a good idea.

268
00:12:11,402 --> 00:12:13,830
Thing is,
I just moved to Toronto,

269
00:12:13,855 --> 00:12:15,744
so I don't really know anyone here yet.

270
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:19,643
When my husband quit our marriage,

271
00:12:19,668 --> 00:12:21,862
I quit the office job I always hated.

272
00:12:22,009 --> 00:12:25,345
Gave myself a year to start
over and open a food truck.

273
00:12:25,370 --> 00:12:28,463
- That's pretty brave.
- Brave and stupid.

274
00:12:28,488 --> 00:12:31,119
I've been driving Uber
to keep things afloat.

275
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:33,034
Oh.

276
00:12:33,059 --> 00:12:34,713
Sorry.

277
00:12:34,738 --> 00:12:36,908
Your stitches tore through your skin.

278
00:12:36,933 --> 00:12:39,096
Have you been moving around a lot?

279
00:12:39,121 --> 00:12:41,244
I'm guessing that's not
supposed to happen?

280
00:12:41,269 --> 00:12:43,073
Don't worry. I'll re-suture,

281
00:12:43,098 --> 00:12:45,276
and then, uh, we'll figure it out.

282
00:12:46,502 --> 00:12:48,791
Why weren't you moving
if the light turned green?

283
00:12:48,816 --> 00:12:51,617
You're always the one honking
to go before it even changes.

284
00:12:51,642 --> 00:12:54,908
It was green barely a second
before she hit me.

285
00:12:57,717 --> 00:13:00,846
Good news, your CT came back
negative for any head injury.

286
00:13:00,871 --> 00:13:03,340
Great, but if she didn't
actually hit her head,

287
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,901
why did you check it?

288
00:13:05,119 --> 00:13:07,979
He... He's just being thorough.

289
00:13:08,966 --> 00:13:11,791
- I'll give you guys some space.
- No, please.

290
00:13:12,102 --> 00:13:13,903
What aren't you telling me?

291
00:13:14,411 --> 00:13:15,645
Nothing.

292
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,871
Sonja?

293
00:13:16,896 --> 00:13:19,298
I, um, I passed out earlier.

294
00:13:19,323 --> 00:13:20,991
You passed out?

295
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:22,518
In the accident?

296
00:13:22,543 --> 00:13:24,872
No, when I got here
and I didn't want to tell you

297
00:13:24,897 --> 00:13:26,833
because I didn't want you to worry.

298
00:13:28,523 --> 00:13:30,190
Are you using again?

299
00:13:30,215 --> 00:13:32,809
No, Jason! I swear.

300
00:13:32,834 --> 00:13:35,402
Then why didn't you tell me
you passed out? Why lie?

301
00:13:35,427 --> 00:13:38,112
Because I was afraid you were gonna
jump to this exact conclusion.

302
00:13:38,137 --> 00:13:39,465
Or because you were high

303
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:41,137
and that's why you didn't
see the light change.

304
00:13:41,162 --> 00:13:42,355
No, I wasn't!

305
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:43,788
I was distracted for, like, a second

306
00:13:43,813 --> 00:13:45,443
and then she slammed into me!

307
00:13:45,468 --> 00:13:47,569
You drove the kids this morning.

308
00:13:48,483 --> 00:13:50,854
Did you get high and drive the kids?

309
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:52,223
No, Jason!

310
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:54,285
- You have to believe me!
- How can I?

311
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:55,838
After everything we've been through?

312
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:58,315
- Because I wouldn't do that...
- Except you have!

313
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:00,271
When you picked up Tessa from dance!

314
00:14:00,296 --> 00:14:03,590
Her carpool got messed up
and she was by herself!

315
00:14:03,615 --> 00:14:05,144
Excuses! My God!

316
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,504
Look, I know things
were messed up, Jason!

317
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:09,144
But I swore to you I
wouldn't do it again!

318
00:14:09,169 --> 00:14:12,355
But you did! And you knew
this was your last chance!

319
00:14:12,380 --> 00:14:14,105
Gosh, I should have seen it.

320
00:14:14,155 --> 00:14:16,135
You've been distant lately.

321
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,363
Barely present.

322
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,293
Yeah, because I've been in pain!

323
00:14:19,318 --> 00:14:20,863
I wasn't using!

324
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:23,189
I wanted to, Jay, but I didn't!

325
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:25,324
I didn't even ask the
doctor for painkillers.

326
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:28,043
That doesn't mean you didn't
take something before.

327
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:30,669
That's what you're waiting for the
test results to prove, right?

328
00:14:30,694 --> 00:14:33,324
The labs could tell us
a number of different things.

329
00:14:33,349 --> 00:14:35,605
You promised we were done
with this!

330
00:14:36,496 --> 00:14:37,822
You're out of chances.

331
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:39,996
Jason, don't...

332
00:14:40,021 --> 00:14:42,863
- Don't do this, just, just...
- Don't come home tonight.

333
00:14:42,888 --> 00:14:45,644
I don't want you around
our kids anymore.

334
00:14:46,216 --> 00:14:48,262
Jason, wait!

335
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,441
Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

336
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:54,113
(MOANING)

337
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:58,291
- I'll get you on fluids.
- I don't need fluids.

338
00:14:58,316 --> 00:15:00,348
We have resources
that can help you.

339
00:15:00,373 --> 00:15:02,807
- There's a detox nurse on staff.
- No!

340
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:04,744
I can get you Suboxone
for withdrawal.

341
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:06,069
I said no!

342
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:07,555
I don't want your help.

343
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,699
A doctor like you gave me
pain meds in the first place

344
00:15:09,724 --> 00:15:11,355
and got me into this mess.

345
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,910
I'm sorry.

346
00:15:12,935 --> 00:15:15,051
I'll be back with your lab results.

347
00:15:21,552 --> 00:15:22,926
Dr. Hamed.

348
00:15:23,176 --> 00:15:25,678
Your sister's school called
and it sounded urgent.

349
00:15:25,703 --> 00:15:26,980
Go.

350
00:15:27,005 --> 00:15:29,504
- We'll cover if we have to.
- Thank you.

351
00:15:32,075 --> 00:15:34,371
I need to add labs
for Navia Khan.

352
00:15:34,396 --> 00:15:36,059
- That's the bladder rupture?
- Yeah.

353
00:15:36,084 --> 00:15:37,967
Isn't she just waiting
for her Urology consult?

354
00:15:37,992 --> 00:15:39,488
I know you don't want me
overdiagnosing,

355
00:15:39,513 --> 00:15:41,168
but her stitches tore
right through her skin

356
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:42,426
despite a lack of physical motion.

357
00:15:42,451 --> 00:15:44,066
- She's also bruising easily...
- Dr. Leblanc.

358
00:15:44,091 --> 00:15:45,832
No, true, neither of those
things point anything concrete,

359
00:15:45,863 --> 00:15:47,465
but something in the way
her bladder ruptured,

360
00:15:47,490 --> 00:15:49,418
even without pelvic fracture
was already bothering me...

361
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:51,754
I agree! I read her chart.

362
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:54,465
Didn't she also have a shoulder
dislocation from the accident?

363
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,418
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
A history of them, actually.

364
00:15:56,443 --> 00:15:58,243
Do you think that's connected?

365
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:00,266
I think you should look into it.

366
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:03,394
- Keep me in the loop.
- I'll call the lab.

367
00:16:03,973 --> 00:16:08,066
I think you have created a
monster in your own image.

368
00:16:08,332 --> 00:16:11,980
One day, we are all gonna be
working for Mags.

369
00:16:14,759 --> 00:16:16,793
Thanks so much for coming in.

370
00:16:16,818 --> 00:16:19,504
We were making family trees in class.

371
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:22,371
Amira didn't want to make hers.

372
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:24,969
I guess her classmate
Candace made a comment

373
00:16:24,994 --> 00:16:27,559
about her not doing one
and things got heated.

374
00:16:27,648 --> 00:16:29,315
Candace started shoving first...

375
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:31,480
- Are they okay?
- They're both fine.

376
00:16:32,076 --> 00:16:34,012
We asked the girls to apologize.

377
00:16:34,037 --> 00:16:36,951
Candace did, but Amira
said there was no point

378
00:16:36,976 --> 00:16:39,349
since she'd be going back
to Syria soon anyway.

379
00:16:40,139 --> 00:16:41,706
I don't know
why she would say that.

380
00:16:41,731 --> 00:16:43,465
She knows it's not true.

381
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:46,466
Is anything going on at home

382
00:16:46,491 --> 00:16:48,482
that might be affecting her mood?

383
00:16:50,761 --> 00:16:53,429
We're moving apartments again,
and...

384
00:16:53,615 --> 00:16:55,325
I know she's not too thrilled about it,

385
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:57,560
but maybe it's affecting
her more than I realized.

386
00:16:57,585 --> 00:16:59,810
At this age,
it's easier for them to hide

387
00:16:59,835 --> 00:17:01,302
when things aren't going well.

388
00:17:01,327 --> 00:17:04,429
Lately, she's been withdrawn,

389
00:17:04,454 --> 00:17:05,987
not turning in assignments...

390
00:17:06,012 --> 00:17:07,546
So she's not doing her homework?

391
00:17:08,532 --> 00:17:11,654
I'm concerned Amira's
holding a lot in.

392
00:17:15,717 --> 00:17:17,841
<i>(PATIENT): Give me the blue one, bud.</i>

393
00:17:18,763 --> 00:17:20,216
Thanks.

394
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:22,000
Hey!

395
00:17:22,746 --> 00:17:24,333
I know they said
I should be resting,

396
00:17:24,358 --> 00:17:27,263
but this is the best medicine
that I could hope for.

397
00:17:27,288 --> 00:17:28,818
Okay, well, I just came

398
00:17:28,843 --> 00:17:30,948
to let you guys know that
everything went well.

399
00:17:30,973 --> 00:17:33,583
We took out the sponges, and
cleared the infected tissue.

400
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:35,638
I thought it was indigestion.

401
00:17:36,082 --> 00:17:38,552
I can't believe there was
something rotting inside me.

402
00:17:38,786 --> 00:17:40,990
He didn't want to have
the hernia surgery either,

403
00:17:41,015 --> 00:17:45,083
but he had been in pain
so long, so I pushed him.

404
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:48,912
Emily, hon, you couldn't have
known this would happen.

405
00:17:49,098 --> 00:17:50,866
Help me out here, doc!

406
00:17:51,105 --> 00:17:54,074
Manny's right. This is
what we call a never event.

407
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:55,982
As in, it never should've happened.

408
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,422
I don't wanna waste any time
dwelling on the negative.

409
00:17:58,447 --> 00:18:00,427
Cameron has his soccer
tournament next weekend.

410
00:18:00,452 --> 00:18:01,849
You need to take care of yourself.

411
00:18:01,874 --> 00:18:03,208
Cam and I need you healthy.

412
00:18:03,233 --> 00:18:05,419
Look, you just
get some rest, okay?

413
00:18:05,444 --> 00:18:06,982
Let your body heal.

414
00:18:07,007 --> 00:18:08,675
And take care of your dad, alright?

415
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,841
Alright.

416
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:11,591
I'll check on you guys later.

417
00:18:11,689 --> 00:18:13,089
Thank you.

418
00:18:25,486 --> 00:18:27,893
Your teacher tells me
you pushed another student.

419
00:18:27,918 --> 00:18:29,253
She pushed me first!

420
00:18:29,278 --> 00:18:31,312
That doesn't mean you push back.

421
00:18:32,031 --> 00:18:33,832
If you're having issues at school,

422
00:18:33,857 --> 00:18:35,339
you need to be honest with me.

423
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,242
I know you don't want
to move apartments,

424
00:18:39,267 --> 00:18:40,940
is that why you've been upset?

425
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,331
If we leave Theo's, it's just
gonna be us again, and...

426
00:18:45,298 --> 00:18:47,417
I won't have anyone to talk to.

427
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,151
Amira, that's not true.

428
00:18:51,322 --> 00:18:52,856
You can talk to me!

429
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,182
Hmm?

430
00:18:55,577 --> 00:18:58,683
Why don't you tell me what
happened with the family tree?

431
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:04,213
They called me in the middle of the day,

432
00:19:04,238 --> 00:19:05,573
telling me that you've been in a fight,

433
00:19:05,598 --> 00:19:07,354
that you're not doing your assignments.

434
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:09,356
And you know you can't go back to Syria,

435
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:10,636
why are you telling people we are?

436
00:19:10,661 --> 00:19:12,328
Because I wish we were!
I hate it here!

437
00:19:12,353 --> 00:19:13,453
You hate it here?

438
00:19:13,478 --> 00:19:15,305
You know you are the
only reason we're here!

439
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,847
The only reason I came!

440
00:19:16,872 --> 00:19:17,956
How could I know that?

441
00:19:17,981 --> 00:19:20,768
You say we should be honest,
but we're not! We never are!

442
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:28,997
I'm sorry.

443
00:19:29,676 --> 00:19:32,778
Would you... do you want to come
back to the hospital with me?

444
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:34,089
I have detention.

445
00:19:34,114 --> 00:19:36,698
Sorry they bothered you at work.

446
00:19:45,391 --> 00:19:48,355
Trauma bag has naloxone,
epi, atropine,

447
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:49,905
and gear for surgical airway.

448
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,343
Thanks for letting me
tag along to log my hours.

449
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:55,037
Yeah, I guess congratulations
are in order.

450
00:19:55,062 --> 00:19:56,983
Have you moved your family here already?

451
00:19:57,008 --> 00:19:59,229
We're still, uh,

452
00:19:59,254 --> 00:20:01,928
we're just trying to figure out
how all that's gonna work.

453
00:20:01,953 --> 00:20:04,370
Well, get ready to test
your mettle.

454
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:09,292
What's Sudbury, like four hours by car?

455
00:20:09,317 --> 00:20:11,936
How long do you think you're go to
be doing the back and forth thing?

456
00:20:11,961 --> 00:20:14,295
Uh, as long as I need to, I guess.

457
00:20:14,475 --> 00:20:17,030
Your wife doesn't wanna
move here?

458
00:20:17,201 --> 00:20:20,226
I kind of took the offer

459
00:20:20,251 --> 00:20:22,022
before really discussing it with her.

460
00:20:22,047 --> 00:20:23,537
Ah, so you're an idiot.

461
00:20:23,562 --> 00:20:25,272
Why did you do that?

462
00:20:25,798 --> 00:20:27,599
Because I wanted it.

463
00:20:27,624 --> 00:20:30,311
Yeah, I thought I was
taking control of my life,

464
00:20:30,336 --> 00:20:33,071
- but I guess I was just...
- Avoiding the conflict.

465
00:20:33,524 --> 00:20:35,547
Yeah. I hoped she'd come around,

466
00:20:35,572 --> 00:20:38,287
but she hasn't and if
I walk it back now...

467
00:20:38,312 --> 00:20:39,812
Hmm, it won't be the same.

468
00:20:39,837 --> 00:20:42,342
She'll always wonder
if you just settled.

469
00:20:42,367 --> 00:20:43,701
Yeah.

470
00:20:48,084 --> 00:20:50,311
Hello, sir. 9-1-1 response?

471
00:20:50,336 --> 00:20:52,905
Are you sure you got
the right address?

472
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:54,197
2319 Berkley.

473
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:56,592
We got a call about a minor
with a wrist injury?

474
00:20:57,076 --> 00:20:59,108
A minor with a wrist injury.

475
00:20:59,133 --> 00:21:01,998
Um, I didn't know that he called.
Come on in.

476
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:11,647
Benjamin! Can you come
down here, please?

477
00:21:12,670 --> 00:21:14,237
Hey, buddy!

478
00:21:14,262 --> 00:21:16,264
Did you call 9-1-1?

479
00:21:17,303 --> 00:21:19,227
Why didn't you tell me
you were doing that?

480
00:21:19,252 --> 00:21:20,685
Hi, Benjamin!

481
00:21:20,877 --> 00:21:23,092
I'm Joanie. This is Theo.

482
00:21:23,117 --> 00:21:24,944
- Hi.
- No school today?

483
00:21:24,969 --> 00:21:26,561
Our school had a PA day.

484
00:21:26,586 --> 00:21:28,733
Which means since Mom's
out of town,

485
00:21:28,758 --> 00:21:30,819
Dad gets to work from home today.

486
00:21:31,256 --> 00:21:33,241
You wanna tell us
what happened here?

487
00:21:33,476 --> 00:21:36,834
I'd managed to coax him away
from his video games.

488
00:21:36,859 --> 00:21:39,787
And, um, we went outside,
toss the football around,

489
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:42,991
and after about 10 minutes,
Ben fell on his wrist.

490
00:21:43,016 --> 00:21:44,350
Ouch.

491
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,576
Well, can we agree
that calling in the cavalry

492
00:21:46,601 --> 00:21:48,366
was a bit of an overreaction?

493
00:21:48,391 --> 00:21:50,123
I'm sure these two have
more important calls

494
00:21:50,148 --> 00:21:52,456
they should be responding too, hmm?

495
00:21:52,481 --> 00:21:53,951
Sorry.

496
00:21:56,567 --> 00:21:58,631
Actually, you guys are in luck.

497
00:21:58,656 --> 00:22:01,652
Theo's a pediatrician, so he
can check you out right now

498
00:22:01,677 --> 00:22:03,848
and you may not even need
to go to the hospital.

499
00:22:03,873 --> 00:22:05,178
Great.

500
00:22:05,203 --> 00:22:06,897
Yeah, why don't you
take a seat, bud?

501
00:22:06,922 --> 00:22:08,655
Sir, do you have
your son's health card?

502
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,537
There's some information
I need to note down.

503
00:22:10,573 --> 00:22:11,659
Uh, yeah.

504
00:22:11,684 --> 00:22:13,051
You mind if I take a look?

505
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:14,514
Yeah?

506
00:22:15,009 --> 00:22:17,608
I want you to tell me where
it hurts the most, okay.

507
00:22:18,325 --> 00:22:20,889
My dad was just trying
to show me how to take a tackle.

508
00:22:20,914 --> 00:22:23,006
He didn't mean for me to get hurt.

509
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,778
(MOANING)

510
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:28,217
Now, you've been hurt
playing sports with him before?

511
00:22:28,242 --> 00:22:30,909
Broke a couple fingers once.

512
00:22:30,934 --> 00:22:32,475
There.

513
00:22:32,872 --> 00:22:34,451
It hurts there the most.

514
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:39,342
Alright, Benjamin...

515
00:22:41,198 --> 00:22:43,428
Does your dad play a
little rough with you?

516
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:45,530
No, it's okay.

517
00:22:45,670 --> 00:22:47,747
Some people just play differently

518
00:22:47,772 --> 00:22:49,248
and they don't realize it.

519
00:22:49,544 --> 00:22:52,405
He says I need to toughen up.

520
00:23:01,329 --> 00:23:04,380
Hey, Bash. Bishop asked me
to cover for your patients.

521
00:23:04,405 --> 00:23:05,595
Said you had to step out.

522
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,241
Are you okay? Is everything okay?

523
00:23:07,358 --> 00:23:08,639
Everything's fine.

524
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:11,764
Did Sonja Jessup's blood work come back?

525
00:23:12,064 --> 00:23:15,108
Yes, but not before she left.

526
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:17,521
A nurse tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't stay.

527
00:23:17,683 --> 00:23:20,100
I wish she'd change her mind,
let us get her some help.

528
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:24,123
Actually, um, she didn't have
any opioids in her system.

529
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,006
You're saying Sonja
wasn't using?

530
00:23:28,031 --> 00:23:30,069
Blood work was clean. Yeah.

531
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:33,888
I tried treating her
for withdrawal.

532
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:36,576
I didn't believe her. No
wonder she didn't stay.

533
00:23:36,601 --> 00:23:38,346
It was a reasonable
assumption to make.

534
00:23:38,371 --> 00:23:40,264
Yeah, but that means there's
something else wrong with her.

535
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:42,397

(HEART MONITOR BEEPING)

537
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,642
What happened?

538
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:56,204
A massive embolism.

539
00:23:56,229 --> 00:23:58,376
Clot blocked the blood
flow to his heart.

540
00:23:58,401 --> 00:24:00,087
He arrested immediately.

541
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:03,033
Code blue team did everything
they could to bring him back,

542
00:24:03,058 --> 00:24:05,026
but nothing.

543
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,751
There were no warning signs?

544
00:24:06,776 --> 00:24:08,392
We had him on anti-coags,

545
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:10,681
but when it's this big and sudden,

546
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:12,587
there's nothing we can do.

547
00:24:15,606 --> 00:24:17,040
His wife and kid.

548
00:24:17,073 --> 00:24:18,206
I'll talk to them.

549
00:24:18,231 --> 00:24:20,323
- No. I can handle it.
- I know you can.

550
00:24:20,348 --> 00:24:22,900
But you've got enough going
on today with your dad.

551
00:24:22,925 --> 00:24:26,189
He's in recovery. You can go see him.

(SOBBING)

553
00:24:48,035 --> 00:24:51,046
Looks like we'll have to take
that trip to Memorial after all.

554
00:24:51,274 --> 00:24:53,202
So, it is broken.

555
00:24:53,227 --> 00:24:56,319
We need an X-ray to be sure,
but it looks that way.

556
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:58,507
Ah. You'll be okay, Ben.

557
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:01,268
We just need to wait
for the police to arrive.

558
00:25:01,565 --> 00:25:02,912
You called the police?

559
00:25:02,937 --> 00:25:06,389
They respond to every 9-1-1 call.
We just got here first.

560
00:25:06,677 --> 00:25:08,412
They'll need you to
give them a statement.

561
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,470
Okay, about what? His wrist?

562
00:25:10,495 --> 00:25:11,788
Yes. How it happened.

563
00:25:11,813 --> 00:25:13,991
I'm sorry, Dad. I didn't know
the police would come.

564
00:25:14,016 --> 00:25:15,016
It's okay, it's okay.

565
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,219
I'll tell them it was an accident!

566
00:25:16,244 --> 00:25:17,897
Ben! That's enough!

567
00:25:18,189 --> 00:25:21,194
Look, I don't think there's any need

568
00:25:21,219 --> 00:25:22,744
to make a statement to the police.

569
00:25:22,769 --> 00:25:24,843
Well, when a minor's involved,
there is.

570
00:25:24,868 --> 00:25:26,163
We were just horsing around.

571
00:25:26,188 --> 00:25:27,461
Kids fall all the time.

572
00:25:27,486 --> 00:25:29,249
Maybe, but the fact is

573
00:25:29,274 --> 00:25:31,401
Benjamin broke his wrist
when you tackled him.

574
00:25:31,426 --> 00:25:32,999
The police are gonna need
to hear what happened.

575
00:25:33,024 --> 00:25:35,510
Okay. So, if we're gonna
go to the hospital,

576
00:25:35,535 --> 00:25:37,241
then I'm gonna take him there myself.

577
00:25:37,266 --> 00:25:39,038
Alright? Let's go, Ben.

578
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:40,989
Sir, let's just
wait for the police.

579
00:25:41,014 --> 00:25:42,632
- Get out of my way.
- Dad, don't!

580
00:25:42,657 --> 00:25:44,226
Quiet!

581
00:25:45,589 --> 00:25:47,189
Move.

582
00:25:47,952 --> 00:25:50,155
I said move!

583
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:52,593
You're scaring your son.

584
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:56,027
Lower your voice and
wait for the police.

585
00:25:57,136 --> 00:25:59,116
Everything okay in here?

586
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,538
Is it?

587
00:26:03,210 --> 00:26:04,983
This is ridiculous.

588
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:09,058
Navia Khan has a history
of muscle pain and weakness.

589
00:26:09,083 --> 00:26:10,999
At first, I worried it could be MS,

590
00:26:11,024 --> 00:26:13,413
but urinalysis and CBC were negative.

591
00:26:13,438 --> 00:26:15,335
And it wouldn't explain
the ruptured bladder.

592
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,760
Her bruising is extensive,

593
00:26:16,785 --> 00:26:18,671
but her passenger didn't sustain any.

594
00:26:18,696 --> 00:26:19,975
She also has skin atrophy,

595
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,522
which explains the stitches tearing.

596
00:26:21,547 --> 00:26:24,092
Did you check for benign
growths on pressure areas,

597
00:26:24,117 --> 00:26:27,061
- elbows, knees, or even...
- Heart valve problems?

598
00:26:28,386 --> 00:26:30,772
Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.

599
00:26:30,797 --> 00:26:33,599
Most cases of Ehlers-Danlos
take years to diagnose.

600
00:26:33,624 --> 00:26:36,085
If you're right, you saved her a decade

601
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,108
of not knowing what was wrong with her.

602
00:26:40,784 --> 00:26:42,651
Sir, this kind of thing...

603
00:26:42,676 --> 00:26:44,905
Is exactly what I told you
not to get sucked into?

604
00:26:45,132 --> 00:26:46,689
It's hard to find the line.

605
00:26:46,714 --> 00:26:48,491
Yeah. I know it is.

606
00:26:51,311 --> 00:26:53,389
I'll get an echo
and order a skin biopsy

607
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,866
to confirm the diagnosis.

608
00:26:55,178 --> 00:26:56,921
Good work, Dr. Leblanc.

609
00:26:57,318 --> 00:26:59,540
33-year-old woman
collapsed in a coffee shop!

610
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:01,165
She was unconscious when we arrived.

611
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:02,944
We administered Naloxone at the scene.

612
00:27:03,023 --> 00:27:04,390
Sonja Jessup.

613
00:27:04,415 --> 00:27:05,646
She overdosed?

614
00:27:05,671 --> 00:27:07,205
Do we know what she took?

615
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,101
BP's dropping.

616
00:27:09,126 --> 00:27:10,460
Heart rate's 145.

617
00:27:10,485 --> 00:27:12,519
- She's in V-Tach.
- She shouldn't be.

618
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,819
I mean, heart rate decreases
after an overdose.

619
00:27:14,844 --> 00:27:16,344
Isn't this your car accident victim

620
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,718
that walked out AMA this morning?

621
00:27:17,743 --> 00:27:19,732
She lost consciousness
during the physical exam

622
00:27:19,757 --> 00:27:22,999
and her resp rate was low, but
she wasn't on opioids then.

623
00:27:25,283 --> 00:27:27,498
Muffled heart sounds. Scan!

624
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,514
Cardiac tamponade.

625
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:41,846
She needs a pericardiocentesis.

626
00:27:41,871 --> 00:27:43,314
We need to drain the
fluid around her heart.

627
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:44,372
Okay. Do it.

628
00:27:44,397 --> 00:27:46,244
I need an 18 gauge 7cm needle

629
00:27:46,269 --> 00:27:47,602
with a 30CC syringe.

630
00:27:47,627 --> 00:27:49,103
Got it.

631
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:56,033
I see the trajectory.

632
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:57,721
Claire, keep the field in view.

633
00:27:57,746 --> 00:27:59,450
Use the subside forward
approach.

634
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:02,408
And aim towards the left shoulder.

635
00:28:08,089 --> 00:28:09,590
SATS are falling.

636
00:28:09,615 --> 00:28:11,088
I don't feel it yet.

637
00:28:11,113 --> 00:28:14,299
Go easy. You're not quite in.

638
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:21,900
Got it.

639
00:28:31,054 --> 00:28:32,640
She's stabilizing.

640
00:28:42,767 --> 00:28:44,617
I let her leave.

641
00:28:46,066 --> 00:28:47,700
This is on me.

642
00:28:55,169 --> 00:28:57,161
Sonja left the hospital and OD'd?!

643
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:58,797
She's stable now.

644
00:28:58,972 --> 00:29:01,271
Okay? Here.

645
00:29:01,818 --> 00:29:03,910
This is what I've been dreading.

646
00:29:04,618 --> 00:29:06,746
This is my worst nightmare.

647
00:29:09,274 --> 00:29:11,709
Jason,
you should also know that...

648
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:15,546
there were no opioids in
her system this morning.

649
00:29:16,249 --> 00:29:17,872
You're saying...

650
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:21,176
she wasn't high when she drove the kids?

651
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:24,325
Well that means,

652
00:29:24,350 --> 00:29:27,643
she only went and used
after I accused her?

653
00:29:30,263 --> 00:29:31,964
This is my fault!

654
00:29:33,065 --> 00:29:34,919
I told her not to come home!

655
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:37,755
She could've died!
But she didn't.

656
00:29:40,471 --> 00:29:43,638
She's sedated right now, but
you'll be able to see her soon.

657
00:29:43,663 --> 00:29:45,164
Okay?

658
00:29:49,585 --> 00:29:51,505
It wasn't the car accident

659
00:29:51,530 --> 00:29:53,501
that caused my bladder to rupture?

660
00:29:53,895 --> 00:29:55,294
It was this other thing?

661
00:29:55,319 --> 00:29:58,029
Well, it was a combination
of the two things,

662
00:29:58,054 --> 00:30:00,435
but if you hadn't been
in the car accident,

663
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:01,598
we may never have found out,

664
00:30:01,623 --> 00:30:03,341
because it meant several
of your symptoms

665
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:04,433
presented at once.

666
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:05,737
And this condition.

667
00:30:05,906 --> 00:30:07,556
Ehlers-Danlos?

668
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:09,888
- Is it serious?
- It can be.

669
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,645
Your joints dislocate more often.

670
00:30:12,917 --> 00:30:14,567
You bruise easily.

671
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:17,817
You might experience
extreme muscle pain,

672
00:30:17,842 --> 00:30:19,709
or be prone to ruptured organs,

673
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,111
like your bladder.

674
00:30:21,294 --> 00:30:24,129
But the good news is
it's not degenerative,

675
00:30:24,251 --> 00:30:25,889
so it's not gonna get worse.

676
00:30:27,901 --> 00:30:29,496
But there's no cure.

677
00:30:32,293 --> 00:30:34,228
So I'll have it forever?

678
00:30:34,272 --> 00:30:35,673
I'm sorry, Navia.

679
00:30:35,865 --> 00:30:37,666
I know it's not...

680
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:40,339
It's not what you were
expecting to hear.

681
00:30:40,874 --> 00:30:43,342
I convinced myself
I was strong enough

682
00:30:43,367 --> 00:30:46,559
to throw everything out and
start this big adventure.

683
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:49,019
And now, you're telling me I'm broken,

684
00:30:49,100 --> 00:30:51,892
fragile, and there's
nothing I can do about it?

685
00:30:52,015 --> 00:30:53,716
You can be prepared.

686
00:30:53,823 --> 00:30:55,403
Watch for any warning signs.

687
00:30:55,428 --> 00:30:57,429
Be more careful in your
day-to-day activities.

688
00:30:57,454 --> 00:30:59,401
I never should have left home.

689
00:31:00,873 --> 00:31:03,112
Now I'm alone with this.

690
00:31:08,073 --> 00:31:09,507
Hey, Ben.

691
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,621
How's your arm?

692
00:31:13,138 --> 00:31:15,040
I heard your mom's on her way back.

693
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:17,418
They said my Dad might not get
to come home tonight.

694
00:31:17,615 --> 00:31:19,504
It's all my fault.

695
00:31:20,855 --> 00:31:22,622
Ben, none of this is your fault.

696
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,182
If I was tougher,
this wouldn't be happening!

697
00:31:26,421 --> 00:31:28,595
When your dad plays rough
with you like that,

698
00:31:28,939 --> 00:31:30,339
it's not okay.

699
00:31:30,376 --> 00:31:33,226
It has nothing to do
with how tough you are.

700
00:31:33,578 --> 00:31:37,313
(CRYING)

701
00:31:45,379 --> 00:31:47,532
The father's
a real piece of work.

702
00:31:47,557 --> 00:31:50,784
Insists the kid just landed wrong.

703
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,996
Ben landed where his dad
tackled him.

704
00:31:53,021 --> 00:31:54,997
And he's pretty upset about it.

705
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,694
Thinks he's got his dad into trouble.

706
00:31:56,719 --> 00:31:58,459
His dad got himself
into trouble.

707
00:31:58,636 --> 00:32:01,128
Let's hope he smartens himself up.

708
00:32:04,235 --> 00:32:06,301
Last chance to back out.

709
00:32:10,638 --> 00:32:12,897
Welcome to the team.

710
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:32,636
(TELEVISION PLAYING)

711
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,664
Why did you tell Singh
you were coming to stay with me?

712
00:32:37,689 --> 00:32:39,070
I'm fine.

713
00:32:40,016 --> 00:32:41,717
Thanks for asking.

714
00:32:41,742 --> 00:32:43,442
Yeah, I know.
I checked your chart.

715
00:32:43,857 --> 00:32:46,259
It got your attention,
didn't it?

716
00:32:47,341 --> 00:32:48,775
You're unbelievable.

717
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:50,334
I...

718
00:32:51,723 --> 00:32:54,325
I hoped you might say yes, okay?

719
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:56,392
I know you hate me.

720
00:32:57,257 --> 00:33:01,521
That you haven't forgiven
me for my mistakes.

721
00:33:03,544 --> 00:33:04,890
I'm all alone here, June.

722
00:33:04,915 --> 00:33:06,352
Don't put that on me.

723
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:08,144
You're alone because
you've hurt everyone

724
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:09,636
who's ever cared about you.

725
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:11,043
Yeah.

726
00:33:11,841 --> 00:33:13,360
You're right.

727
00:33:21,562 --> 00:33:24,212
You know, I'm stronger
than I used to be.

728
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:27,825
I'm not just gonna let
you do that to me again.

729
00:33:27,979 --> 00:33:30,092
I don't wanna hurt you, June.

730
00:33:31,794 --> 00:33:33,061
I wanna be in your life.

731
00:33:33,669 --> 00:33:36,914
Every time I let you in,
I'm the one who ends up paying.

732
00:33:36,939 --> 00:33:38,706
(SIGHING)

733
00:33:38,928 --> 00:33:42,397
Maybe it was like that before,
but now...

734
00:33:42,422 --> 00:33:45,664
You know, you say you've changed,
but you lied to my boss!

735
00:33:45,689 --> 00:33:48,944
You lied to my boss to
get me to talk to you?

736
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,320
Okay, that was, um,
that was a mistake.

737
00:33:52,345 --> 00:33:54,711
- I can do better.
- I don't think you can.

738
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:56,526
And even if you could,

739
00:33:56,594 --> 00:33:59,455
I don't think I can give
you another chance, so...

740
00:34:01,391 --> 00:34:03,625
(CRYING)

741
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:10,883
So, uh..

742
00:34:11,597 --> 00:34:13,885
You know, Dr. Singh's a great doctor.

743
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:15,804
And if you need anything at home,

744
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:17,681
I will find you a nurse.

745
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:20,684
But that's all.

746
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,962
You know, I've see all kinds,
working here.

747
00:34:26,824 --> 00:34:28,664
All kinds of love.

748
00:34:32,051 --> 00:34:35,324
Seen people lose families
and find families.

749
00:34:36,459 --> 00:34:38,452
But that's just not who we are.

(COUGHING)

751
00:34:49,541 --> 00:34:50,875
Hi.

752
00:34:52,967 --> 00:34:55,386
Your husband was just here.

753
00:34:56,607 --> 00:34:59,014
He's making arrangements
for the kids.

754
00:35:02,298 --> 00:35:03,765
I...

755
00:35:03,998 --> 00:35:05,969
I didn't believe you, Sonja.

756
00:35:05,994 --> 00:35:08,608
I'm... I'm sorry.

757
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:14,988
Turns out you were right not to.

758
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:19,133
You stopped once.

759
00:35:19,158 --> 00:35:20,592
You can stop again.

760
00:35:20,617 --> 00:35:23,914
Yeah, but the pain
never goes away.

761
00:35:25,854 --> 00:35:28,752
One bad moment sends me over the edge.

762
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,215
I know my family keeps hoping
that this is over, but...

763
00:35:34,508 --> 00:35:36,676
it's never over.

764
00:35:38,081 --> 00:35:40,016
Now, when I look at my life,

765
00:35:40,818 --> 00:35:43,058
all I see is this void.

766
00:35:44,638 --> 00:35:46,479
This giant void.

767
00:35:50,188 --> 00:35:52,150
You have to face it.

768
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:55,321
What if I can't?

769
00:35:59,581 --> 00:36:01,744
What if I'm not strong enough?

770
00:36:03,625 --> 00:36:05,497
But you are.

771
00:36:14,831 --> 00:36:17,295

_

773
00:36:28,839 --> 00:36:30,146
Hey!

774
00:36:30,643 --> 00:36:31,822
Hey!

775
00:36:31,847 --> 00:36:34,568
- You're back?
- Yeah.

776
00:36:35,555 --> 00:36:38,155
I went to this party, but...

777
00:36:38,682 --> 00:36:41,116
I can't stop thinking about my patient.

778
00:36:41,236 --> 00:36:43,363
I told her she had Ehlers-Danlos today,

779
00:36:43,388 --> 00:36:45,055
and she took it pretty hard.

780
00:36:45,739 --> 00:36:47,297
I came back, because...

781
00:36:47,322 --> 00:36:51,209
Because you're Mags,
so what do you do?

782
00:36:52,822 --> 00:36:54,505
Yeah.

783
00:37:03,571 --> 00:37:04,915
Hi.

784
00:37:05,154 --> 00:37:06,585
Hi.

785
00:37:06,610 --> 00:37:08,239
I heard your surgery went well.

786
00:37:08,264 --> 00:37:10,645
You should be going home tomorrow.

787
00:37:11,336 --> 00:37:12,836
They said you were gone.

788
00:37:12,904 --> 00:37:14,525
Yeah.

789
00:37:24,312 --> 00:37:26,036
I know what it's like.

790
00:37:26,796 --> 00:37:28,474
Feeling fragile.

791
00:37:28,993 --> 00:37:32,849
And questioning what you're...
what you're capable of.

792
00:37:35,089 --> 00:37:38,216
I left everything I knew
to come here.

793
00:37:39,404 --> 00:37:41,968
Follow my passion. And now...

794
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:44,190
You'll make some adjustments.

795
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:47,892
The only way to know how is to try.

796
00:37:55,476 --> 00:37:57,410
So tell me about your food truck.

797
00:37:59,313 --> 00:38:00,696
Seriously?

798
00:38:00,846 --> 00:38:03,365
I don't know that much
about food trucks,

799
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,380
other than I like eating at them! A lot.

800
00:38:06,837 --> 00:38:09,052
But I've got nowhere else to be,

801
00:38:09,077 --> 00:38:10,957
and I'd love to learn more,

802
00:38:11,342 --> 00:38:13,793
if you want the company.

803
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,157
Okay.

804
00:38:18,854 --> 00:38:21,964
- Well, when I was eight...
- Mm-hmm?

805
00:38:22,458 --> 00:38:25,474
My parents used to take me
travelling, a lot...

806
00:38:25,787 --> 00:38:28,556
June, I've been calling you!

807
00:38:28,581 --> 00:38:30,115
I thought we had dinner plans!

808
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:31,779
Yeah, I just figured
you were still mad.

809
00:38:31,804 --> 00:38:33,447
Yeah, so, we hash it out.

810
00:38:33,472 --> 00:38:35,730
That's how this works, right?

811
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,944
I think we should end this.

812
00:38:41,444 --> 00:38:44,203
Okay, whoa,
where did that come from?

813
00:38:44,228 --> 00:38:46,116
You were right, Lou.

814
00:38:47,069 --> 00:38:48,744
I don't let you in.

815
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:51,748
Not you or anyone. I can't.

816
00:38:51,773 --> 00:38:53,790
- If this is about your dad...
- It's about me.

817
00:38:53,815 --> 00:38:56,127
It's about me, alright?

818
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:58,134
Maybe it's because of him,

819
00:38:58,159 --> 00:38:59,716
or maybe it's who I always was,

820
00:38:59,741 --> 00:39:02,476
but I'm not good at this.

821
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:07,436
- And I'm just gonna hurt you.
- You're not him, June.

822
00:39:07,576 --> 00:39:10,557
This kind of stuff
takes practice, right?

823
00:39:13,019 --> 00:39:14,811
Don't do this.

824
00:39:16,090 --> 00:39:18,107
You deserve better.

825
00:39:19,615 --> 00:39:21,318
June, wait!

826
00:39:23,879 --> 00:39:25,822
- Please.
- I'm sorry!

827
00:39:30,007 --> 00:39:31,655
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Bishop?

828
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:33,580
Yeah, come in. Close the door.

829
00:39:38,335 --> 00:39:41,122
About Sonja Jessup, um,
it was my fault.

830
00:39:41,145 --> 00:39:42,583
She left before we could...

831
00:39:42,608 --> 00:39:44,731
We can't keep patients
here against their will.

832
00:39:45,815 --> 00:39:48,345
What happened with Amira?
Was everything okay?

833
00:39:48,474 --> 00:39:51,185
Uh, yeah,
there was some drama at school,

834
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:53,558
but, uh, she's fine.

835
00:39:54,989 --> 00:39:57,812
There was an incident
with another student.

836
00:39:58,215 --> 00:39:59,700
I tried talking to her,

837
00:39:59,725 --> 00:40:02,027
but I guess I'm saying
all the wrong things.

838
00:40:03,878 --> 00:40:05,465
She's 12?

839
00:40:06,136 --> 00:40:07,870
When my son was 12...

840
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:10,950
It gets harder.

841
00:40:11,709 --> 00:40:13,411
Knowing what to say.

842
00:40:14,436 --> 00:40:16,998
Main thing is, you're
there when she needs you.

843
00:40:18,171 --> 00:40:20,403
That's a lesson I learned too late.

844
00:40:20,428 --> 00:40:22,129
Don't make the same mistake I did.

845
00:40:23,192 --> 00:40:24,826
Thank you.

Not yet!

what we're dealing with.

Sonja, you have fluid
on your lungs.

We're going to put a chest
tube in to help you breathe.

Alright?

858
00:40:59,965 --> 00:41:01,751
